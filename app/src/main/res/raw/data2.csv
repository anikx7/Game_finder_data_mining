The game is played at a first person perspective, but it isn't a first person shooter, it is more in the vein of first person adventure game.

The lack of manual aiming without the R buttons is solved via the use of the lock on feature. Negatives-Replay Value: One might not be compelled to play this prolonged adventure again, although if they do they will realize just how excellent the game was when they'd played it the first time. There is also alot of backtracking in the game, but this is usually for the access of new areas and upgrades.10/10",Borg

It was as if I stepped into a portal to my childhood. I highly recommend the ""single joy-con in each hand"" motion control scheme. The motions controls feel so intuitive and really enhance the gameplay. Cappy serves as a great sidekick, with his boomerang and capture abilities providing a refreshing take on the classic 3D Mario Mechanics. Visually, it is a gorgeous game. It maintains 60 fps consistently in both mobile and docked. There seems to be a variety of different environments in this game, unlike Super Mario Galaxy and Sunshine. While those games followed a common theme, Odyssey takes influence from Super Mario 64 and Super Mario World in that there is a (Spoilers) desert world, ghost world. tropical world, metro world, etc. The music is phenomenal. I recommend that everyone use a headset to truly appreciate it. I had chills running down my spine once I heard the theme from the Switch Presentation Trailer for Odyssey. No other franchise has made as big of an impact on the gaming industry as Mario. He is the Micky Mouse of gaming. This game can be enjoyed by anyone. Enthusiast gamers. Father/Mother playing with his or her kids. Teenagers. Anyone. I had lost faith in Nintendo during the Wii U generation. They have absolutely blown me away with putting out masterpieces such as Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey. These 2 games make the Switchh worth it. I must also add that this year has been incredible for gaming. Besides Mario and Zelda, we had Persona 5, Cuphead, Horizon Zero Dawn, Nier, Nioh, Divinity. Instead of debating Game of the Years. We should declare 2017 as the Year of the Games. I hope everyone enjoys these games as much as I have.",K-LAWN

16,Half-Life 2,PC,10,"I just replayed Half-Life 2 again about a month ago.  Even in 2011, seven years after its initial release, I am still reminded why Half-Life 2 is one of the greatest first-person shooters of all time.  Not the greatest, but definitely one of them.I think the greatest strength in Half-Life 2 (gameplay-wise) is the level design.  Over the course of I believe 14 levels, you see anI just replayed Half-Life 2 again about a month ago.  Even in 2011, seven years after its initial release, I am still reminded why Half-Life 2 is one of the greatest first-person shooters of all time.  Not the greatest, but definitely one of them.I think the greatest strength in Half-Life 2 (gameplay-wise) is the level design.  Over the course of I believe 14 levels, you see an incredible variation in locale, level structure, lighting, and gameplay.  This is complimented by such a flux in mood, intensity, and immersion that you can't help but to just be enthralled by it.For instance, the entire first 3 chapters of the game is a slow build-up to an intense climax.  You start as a fugitive, running across the rooftops of City 17 to escape the Combine Overwatch.  You are allowed to take a short, 10-minute breather in a safe-haven, then thrust back into the bowels of the city's sewer system, and finally driving your own airboat through the canals.  It's such a gradual build you hardly notice it, until you reach the end of the climax, discover you've been holding your breath for the past 30 seconds, and that you've been maintaining a white-knuckled grip on your mouse this whole time.  And that's the first 3 chapters.After this you are treated to some incredibly creepy locations, and some more intense escapes/shootouts.  All the atmosphere is enhanced with some pretty incredible performances both animation- and voice-acting-wise, even if you consider that this is 2011.And wow, the voice acting.  These are some of the most incredible video game characters to this date.  Immensely believable, highly emotional, subtly expressive, the characters help suck you right into the story and world that Valve created, and you could almost be fooled into thinking they are actually talking to you...Oh and that reminds me, the story.  Okay, so it's not laid out for you word-for-word what's going on, or what relevance all these characters have in terms of the story from the instance you set foot into the game.  I have read a lot of reviews and seen a lot of complaints.  Yes, Valve did not flesh it out in its entirety in the first chapter.  No, you pretty much don't have a clue what kind of influence the combine and the G-Man are right from the word go.  But to be honest, I don't care.  When it comes to story-telling, I personally enjoy the opportunity to discover the story for myself, and not just have it told to me if I were a five-year-old.  There are some pretty subtle hints laying around concerning backstory, main storyline, and intertwining character plots.  If you look for them, you'll find that this is actually some interesting sci-fi, more driven by characters (which it should be) than by what's necessary to pluck a plot twist out of your ass.  So overall, the story ended up being a plus in my opinion.Other than that, the graphics are still good, though a bit dated, physics are awesome, and the gravity gun continues to be the best weapon in the history of gaming,  Go Valve!  Now I just can't wait until my Portal 2 pre-load finishes...",Duderoth

So many times I would look at a ledge or something I had just grappled to it and would not let me for some reason and I would spam the R1 button, because that is your best bet of getting anywhere, and it would spin me around and grapple something not even on the screen. It can be very frustrating. Also I would be standing next to a wall or ledge and it would not let me hang on it or grab on to it for no reason.

As a sequel to Ocarina of Time it took the basic features of it and enhanced and twisted them into a darker and more perilous setting - Termina. Right from the beginning we can see that the game is darker, with the enigmatic travelling mask salesman and the mystery surrounding Majora's Mask. The whole mask concept is really what makes the game stand out, adding a multitude of side quests and new gameplay as well as making the game feel a lot more dark and mysterious. As many other reviews have said, the game was hard but for me that' part of what made it so great - the increased difficulty not only adds to the challenge but makes the game feel more dark and twisted when compared with Ocarina of Time.

47,World of Goo,Wii,10," Entertaining puzzle game which is different everything else I've been able to find. Multiplayer with more than 2 people can be frustrating but I believe that's due to communication, not game design.

She adds so much to an already fantastic game. Just buy it already!",knox170

51,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4,PlayStation2,10," Another great sequel for a quickly evolving series.

The career mode isn't limited to 2 minute bursts like before. It's surprisingly much more enjoyable this way. Another great sequel for a quickly evolving series.

I knew this game would be different, and seemed really cool. Well, I was disappointed... a lot.The premise seems interesting, where Kratos ventures to a mountain with his son, Atreus. They clearly take a page out of The Last of Us' book, but this is much worse. Neither of the two are as likable as Joel or Ellie, and their relationship does not develop as well either. I don't want to sound like I'm comparing too much to another game, but since they clearly used the other game as an inspiration, it's hard not to. It is cool how the game is all in one take, instead of having separate cutscenes, and their are some interesting side characters, but overall the story is not that great or even close to as epic as the older GoW games.I thought that the graphics were great, with several beautiful environments and moments, and the voice acting and sound design was excellent as well.Now then, the gameplay. I didn't like it, at all. The combat is clunky and dull, where you have very limited weapons and fight repetitive enemy types numerous times. You mainly use one weapon, an axe, but it gets really really old to slash enemies with it, throw it, and do the same finishing moves over and over again. The boss fights aren't that great or exciting, either. I honestly felt like the combat was like the Witcher or Dark Souls, but more boring and repetitive, reminding me of an early PS3 game.There are some complex puzzles, new for a series, that are relatively fun.I am just so disappointed by this game, and do not understand the hype, at all. I know people will say those who don't like it is because it isn't like the older games, but it isn't that. I understand that combat isn't supposed to be the only focus anymore, and the game is supposed t include more of the story and have more nuanced, less brutal/graphic violence. But the combat isn't all that exciting, and with a subpar story and characters, there really isn't much here to be excited about. Other reboots or gameplay changes in series, such as Zelda BoTW, Tomb Raider, and MGS 5 have been great, so I was hopeful for this title. But instead, the changes made here are not successful and have created a very vanilla game. I will say that this is the most overrated game on the PS4.",jpacor

Thankfully Celeste has reminded me why I love this particular genre so much and for me it’s pretty much perfect in every single way. Obviously the most important thing about aRetro platformers is a genre that I’ve been interested in ever since I was a child and there have certainly been some classics over the year’s, but in my opinion this genre has lost its way in recent years. Thankfully Celeste has reminded me why I love this particular genre so much and for me it’s pretty much perfect in every single way. Obviously the most important thing about a platformer is the platforming itself and thankfully everything here has been done to perfection. Each little movement feels great and the amount of immersion the platforming creates is simply wonderful. The controls definitely play a part in making the platforming play great, and they’ve done a great job of keeping things very tight and responsive throughout. Throughout your time with the game you will notice a number of different mechanics in play at the same time and each different mechanic plays a part in creating a unique adventure. Another very important aspect in a game like this is the level design, and thankfully I can say the levels are superb. Each level plays differently from each other and there are a lot of clever concepts in each level and this without a doubt keeps things fresh and makes you want to carry on, which is very important. This is very important because the game can be extremely difficult and you will die a lot of times, so there is a little frustration but it wasn’t enough to stop me from playing and that’s great because in terms of content the game offers you a decent amount and you will enjoy this game for multiple hours. The presentation side of the game created a lot of fond memories for me and it’s certainly packed with a lot of charm. Visually the game screams retro and when you combine that with the excellent sound design then you get a game that takes you down memory lane, but it also has a modern feel to it at the same time which is awesome. At the end of the day I expected a lot from Celeste and it’s managed to reach my lofty expectations and some, which is very impressive to say the least. Everything about the game just clicks and I can see it being on a lot of people’s game’s of the year list come the end of the year. If you love old-school platformers then this is an absolute must buy and it should definitely be included on the best platformers of all time list.",Xbox_Alive

109,Mass Effect 3,Xbox360,2,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Apparently, after DA2 and TORtanic, BioWare have now pinched-out another classic game, enhanced with Day-1 DLC, linear gameplay, ORIGIN for the PC, and a tripartite ending choice that makes many gamers, after having invested dozens upon dozens of hours of gameplay with the franchise, want to commit hari kiri. . . .   Apparently, eschewing much player-choice in this latest sequel to the MASS EFFECT series, BioWare have included their ""awesome-button"" with this dreck, which might be better named MASS APPEAL 3, due to limited exploration, near-complete disregard for historical player-choice and odd design implementation.  Aside from some XBOX technical guffaws, such as my femShep falling through the world during the Tuchanka Eve series with the Hammer activations, extensive plot-changing cutscenes with minimal player-input have derailed a MASS EFFECT series that was originally a player-driven RPG and not a combat-heavy, awesome-button homage to stilted dialogue choices with nearly-identical outcomes.  How BioWare's continuity department envisioned MASS EFFECT 3's wrangling with philosophical, social and moral issues such as implied xenophobia, homosexuality, interspecies coupling and the biological-species-rule, while omitting or ignoring coherent closure with a myriad of player-driven endings is mind-numbing.  Simply put, it is apparent that more design and interplay have been woven into the story arc regarding Shepard's ""top or bottom"" status than the ending of the entire trilogy.  In other words, BioWare had the will, the time and energy to craft homosexual plot threads and allude to interspecies sexual trysts throughout the subtext of MASS EFFECT but could NOT be bothered to make any ending that had consistency with lore, player-choice, the intrinsic MASS EFFECT experience?   This following observation might be simplistic; BUT, what kind of DLC should I buy for a universe that no LONGER EXISTS?   -In other words, shall I play the game AGAIN and see if it turns out any differently?    /facepalm.",bugbear1

There is no doubt in mind that naughty dog spent ages perfecting this game to make it the masterpiece that it is today. The story itself feels like naughty dog took a pace in the direction of how the last of us was made and that is certainly a good thing. The game not only has numerous treasures and letters for you to collect but also many interactive pieces to remind us of the previous titles sparking major nostalgia in me as many of the fans also probably felt. Without spoiling anything I can say the story is phenomenal from beginning to end, through the 14 hours it took me to finish the game on moderate difficulty I can say I did not come out disappointed but couldn't help feeling the want for more, maybe...uncharted 5....I can dream!The multiplayer is very fast paced and addictive, the weapons are vast and there's many different choices you can make whether you prefer a hand on combat approach or you're more of a sneaky sniper.New Perks and mysticals are also a welcome addition as they give players an extra edge in the field.All I can say is that I will be playing the multiplayer for months to come and will shortly be returning to the story to enjoy the lure of the story a second time as well as collect my platinum.Naughty Dog you did it again, you created a MASTERPIECE.10/10 without a doubt in my mind,Enjoy the ride and if you haven't picked it up yet, then what are you waiting for!?",TylerDominic

To begin, let's start with the presentation, graphics and audio. The graphics are very good for n64. The contrast of the 2D characters with the 3D background still holds up today.The music is almost flawless. The title screen music gives the player a sense of fun urgency to begin the adventure, the battle themes are classic, and the remaining themes are all conducted perfectly, fitting their respective environments.The story appears to be typical of a mario game as bowser steals peach and mario must rescue her. However, Paper Mario's story shines in its details. The npcs of the game are given a great amount of characterization, which this creates a sense of connectivity within the game that is not seen in many other mario games. The story is revealed in storybook fashion, with each world being called a chapter instead. Each chapter is completely different from the previous, keeping the game fresh by introducing new environments, objectives, puzzles, characters, and gameplay. After each chapter, you get to see what peach is up to. This is the worst part of the game, as you have to control kidnapped peach in an attempt to find out information to get relayed to mario. However, this is an interesting concept that would get expanded on in the next 2 paper mario games.Onto the actual gameplay elements: As you progress in the game, you pick up several party members. These party members are needed for puzzles and assist you in battle. The battles are turn based, yet are interactive, as you can perform action commands to do more damage or block attacks, much like in mario rpg. As you progress, you get more attacks, upgrades, badges, and items that add an amazing amount of depth and strategy to the game. You can level up if you get enough battle experience. As a kid I didn't know any better but to always increase my heart points (health) rather than allocating it between flower points and badge points. The bosses all bring something new to the table, and you must figure out a strategy to beat each one. Other gameplay elements include solving well thought out puzzles that progressively get more rewarding and challenging, collecting star pieces to get new badges, and exploring the vast maze of the toad town tunnels. Yeah, so in summary, the battle system is pretty amazing and deep and tops off an almost flawless game.",jamba24

159,Super Mario Sunshine,GameCube,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        super mario 64 was great, but then after that, nintendo made a mario game that was very different than the others, super mario sunshine. Now this is one of my favorite mario games, but it's nothing like the regular games, it's probably the only mario game where the mushroom kingdom is not seen at all. So the plot is, mario is going on vacation to isle delfino And once ariving, he sees that the island is splattered with graffiti, after picking up FLUDD A water/backpack thing, they fight a giant graffiti Parana plant. after defeating this thing, the police take mario to court, after probably the most unfair court session i have ever seen, mario is sentenced to clean up the island. it turns out shadow mario (an evil version of mario) did the graffiti.  so now here's where the gameplay starts. the gameplay in super mario sunshine is just like super mario 64. you finish the level by finding a shine spite. now the first thing i have to say is that this game is HARD, probably the second hardest mario game ever behind super mario bros 2 lost levels. so anyway, all of the missions aren't the same goal. the levels in this game are called episodes, and you have to do something different every time to get a shine sprite. like, find all 8 red coins or, complete a secret level, This gameplay setup is very cool especially in a mario game of all things. now for the secret levels, the hardest and most frustrating part of the game,so what happens is shadow mario has taken FLUDD away from you and puts you in an obstacle course with the shine sprite at the end. these are hard, these are classic mario platforming but all of them are unnecessarily hard, you have to platform through these blocks that rotate, spin, and sometimes even push you off the level, I died about 100 times at the noki bay's secret level. one secret level even has these guys that throw you to the next platform and you have to aim perfectly or else they will throw you off the level. anyway, isle delfino has some of the best areas i have ever seen in a mario game, like serina beach, or the beautiful noki bay. and some levels are just amazing, there was this one level in gelato beach where you are on a giant bird made out of sand flying high in the sky, and in another platform up a hill in noki bay. oh, and did i mention that there are yoshis in the game, the first time yoshis are used in a 3D mario game, only thing is that it's not the original green yoshi, just other color yoshis. and after a boss fight it is revealed that shadow mario is bowser jr, that's a pretty good twist, and this is bowser jr's first appearance in a mario game. this game is very underrated, probably because this was the first time a nintendo console was released without a super mario game alongside it. this made fans want the best mario game ever. but this was a great game anyway.  the plot is great and has probably the best twist in any mario game, the levels are nice, the graphics are great, and the music is some of the best in the super mario series. It's probably my 2nd favorite super mario game.",classicgamer321

There has never been such an addicting RTS game out there, so if you still don't own it, buy it! It is more than worth it. And if you already have it, go and play it again!

The skirmish capability is outstanding, allowing the user to play the role of any of a number of races with different strengths and technological abilities.  With some race customization capability and different star systems, this allows for a huge amount of variation in game play.Games can take many hours to play out.  The game allows saving status and resuming.  The biggest weakness for most people is the lack of multiplayer support.  This game is only turn based with one person playing against one or more computer opponents.  Alliances are allowed, either in up front game definition or on the fly, by negotiation between players.  A multiplayer option would be nice, but is difficult to implement because the length of game play is often too long for keeping a group together.After downloading, there is no need for an internet connection to play the game and no disk is needed to play.  This is particularly a plus for PCs without (soon to be obsolete) optical drives.  I appreciate a game that cares about convenience for the user over awkward and annoying copy protection schemes.Reasonable graphics performance requires a midrange graphics card.  Playability suffers a little with too slow a PC, though not nearly as much as reflex based games.The detailed, race based technology trees add complexity and affect strategy choices.  Impressive ship customization options add to thought required and entertainment value.  While a detailed analysis of the science may poke holes (population growth etc), the game is quite sophisticated and presents an interesting hypothetical future.  Unlike many ""strategy"" games, the simple solution of massing a huge army and only then attacking does not work.  Unlike many games, there is an ongoing maintenance cost for ships that are in operation.  Maintaining a very large standing fleet hurts the economy and future military capability.  To win requires a strong economy, manufacturing capability, technology and, of course, fleet.  Much more realistic than most games.  Also something that many political leaders do not pay enough attention to in the real world.",attila_da_hun

With it’s surprise drop last Tuesday during the Nintendo direct.Let’s see if this mech vs bug battle, truly lives up to the hype.Taking place in the future, you are commanding a three mech team trying to clear a group of islands of deadly overgrown creatures known as Veks.  Beginning at one of four islands with a number of procedurally generated regions that you must recapture from the gigantic creepy crawlies.  Each region is an isometric grid with buildings used to maintain your power grid and varying per level objectives, such as defend the power plant or kill 7 Veks.  These objectives aren’t required but give you additional power or reputation points if you can complete them.These reputations points can be spent between islands to purchase different weapons or upgrades for your mechs, adding some tools to your repertoire to make you that much more of a formidable foe.Keeping the Vek away from your buildings can prove quite the challenging task as they will spawn from the ground every turn, when they do get destroyed it feels devastating as civilians die from your wrong decision.  When actually getting a game over, you lose your progression but can keep one pilot for your next run, so if that pilots level up a bit you come into the next game with a little bit of an advantage.As you progress through the game you unlock new islands, which once unlocked can be played through in any order and scale difficulty depending how many islands have been defeated beforehand.  As you defeat more islands or special objectives you earn coins which unlock new TROOPS of mechs for your to command.  Each class being very different, really forcing you to learn and adapt in this brutal environment and I mean brutal.In the beginning of Into the Breach be prepared to die and die ALOT.  Getting a solid understanding of this game will only come with many deaths, even as a seasoned tactical rpg player I have had my butt handed to me unexpectedly on many occasions.  The moment you let your guard down be prepared to lose power, your mechs, and even your life.Acceptable lossesSome of the decisions that i’ve made during a run of into the breach have taken so much time and thought that I’ve often caught myself just staring at my screen for ten minute periods of time.  Weighing each option greatly as the consequences will affect you as such.  If you carelessly make your decisions your run will be over before you know it.  However, if you take your time and strategically chip away at the Vek, before you know you’ll be onto your next island and one step closer to your goal.As there are alot of different systems at work with Into the Breach it will take you some time before everything clicks.  Each enemy has a different abilities, attack orders, and passive effects; when taken advantage of properly you can have enemies taking each other out.  For you to truly succeed at this game you must understand what’s really important in each level.  Yes it would be great to keep all of your mechs at full health, but as long as they survive, keeping your cities intact is really what counts. As you can sometimes get overwhelmed it’s important to keep a level head, take your time, and keep your eye are the goal.  I’ve sometimes reminded myself of an old man staring at a chess board, the way I stop and strategize with this game.The game runs great on handheld and in docked, getting around 5 hours of battery life in handheld.  However, using the joy con joy sticks I found the pointer would occasionally continue traveling when I released the joy stick, causing attacks to execute on the wrong space; and when the stakes are this high that can be quite disheartening.Into the Breach is a fantastic experience with life or death decision making that will have you on the edge of your seat as it unfolds.  While this game is not for the faint of heart, those whom are willing to invest the time will be rewarded greatly for that effort.  With fantastic gameplay, rewarding progression, and emotionally impactful decision making I can happily recommend this roguelike tactical rpg to any fan of the genre.",TheFlannelFox

Certain people can't watch a movie unless it has explosions, certain people can't watch Public Television because it educates rather than entertains, and certain people will pick this up on the recommendation of another and feel 100% cheatedLet me start by stating the facts: not everyone will understand these games, not everyone will enjoy them, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Certain people can't watch a movie unless it has explosions, certain people can't watch Public Television because it educates rather than entertains, and certain people will pick this up on the recommendation of another and feel 100% cheated because it doesn't involve wanton killing, busty women, rampant foul language and guns.If you are one of these types of people, it's okay.  I'm not going to judge you or your tastes.  I'll just let you know that i feel sorry for you, because whatever ""eye of the beholder"" thing it takes to truly enjoy these games, you don't have it, and believe me, your life is worse because of that.  You don't know what you've missed.Ico is definitely the harder game to get into, out of the two games in the collection. It will involve you solving puzzles and leading a girl to safety by escaping the castle where the both of you are imprisoned.  It will involve her speaking in a language you don't understand, and it will tax the part of the brain that won't help you fire a gun.  For those patient enough to brave the journey, you may find yourself with an incredibly emotional experience at the end of the road, and you'll be amazed a video game could make you feel that way.   I'm trying to spoil as little as I can for you, and I'm sorry if this sounds a bit paltry, but this is the gist of the experience.On the other hand, Shadow Of The Colossus is the most beautifully haunting game I've ever played.  It too is about solving puzzles, but the goal in this game is not to figure out how you'll escape a castle, it's how to kill sixteen giant beasts that dwarf you in scale.  No other game has made me feel so overwhelmingly powerful by making me feel so insignificant throughout the entire process - the expansive overworld with no enemies or even epic travel music, the loneliness between your character and the horse he rides, it all seems so pointless until you find your next enemy.  The silence is the calm before the storm, and that storm is the next giant beast you will have to locate, climb and somehow kill.  It will give you a sense of wonder, dread and most of all, it will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that video games deserve to be called an artistic medium. As I said, it won't be for everyone.  But if you find yourself looking for something that could make you proud to own your PlayStation, and you don't mind not shooting a gun or scoring a goal, then you may find yourself in for the best games that the previous generation had to offer.  There's a very good reason why the PlayStation 2 was the home of the best franchise titles of the last hardware generation, and that didn't have as much to to with Grand Theft Auto, Resident Evil, Madden, Final Fantasy or God Of War as it did games like Ico and Shadow Of The Colossus.  Now, these games have been given a 1080p HD facelift, and given trophies for the player to earn as well.  Any individual who considers themselves a gamer, in any sense of the term whether broad or niche, needs to try these two games.  You may find that you don't like them, and like I said earlier, that's okay.  Caviar isn't for everyone, and one man's delicacy can be another's poison.  If you're in the mood for something besides controller McDonalds, though, this is your wake-up call.For those who do pick it up and find themselves lost in the most incredible worlds, your curiosity will be rewarded hundredfold.  Then, you'll understand why people like myself are so excited for The Last Guardian...and chances are, you will be too after playing through these two games (and especially SotC).  Don't pass this up, whatever you do.",EverydayLegend

Gove are the days of OOTP being strictly a text based sim.Then there are the issues, which don't seem to get taken seriously unless you have some predetermined number of posts on their message board.  In ""Historical Exhibition"" mode I had the AI play a relief pitcher at second base.  I also had the game totally ignore the fact that a relief pitcher made it into the game.  You could see he was in the game by go9ing to the screen that shows the current pitcher.  You could see he had fatigue from pitching.  But he didn't appear in the box score.  The response from the head developer:  This problem does not exist.The Fantasy draft is completely broken.  It doesn't display starting pitchers.  If you go to a league in the first round of the daft and have the system sort starting pitchers, there are none.  I started a season in 1994.  If I go to the fantasy draft, like I said no starting pitchers.  If I do a search for guys like David Cone, Randy Johnson or Jimmy Key, the come up in the search field.  Try to draft them... nope, not happening. I have tried this several ways: with the most recent patch, uninstalling and reinstalling an earlier version or even going all the way back the beta version, which I secured by pre-ordering the game and the problem still persists.I guess if somebody who has a couple of thousand posts in the forum ahs these problems they'll be addressed.

186,Final Fantasy VI Advance,GameBoyAdvance,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Review written Friday February 1 of 2013.Final Fantasy VI is the best RPG of all time. It is not only the jewel of the genre itself, but an unique masterpiece as a videogame, standing high as one of the best videogames of the human history. The game is a narrative to take it as an experience that any other videogame could tell you. The combination of all these factors make Final Fantasy VI something more than a very creative videogame, it makes it a life experience, and of course, a must have in any RPG collection. Final Fantasy VI is, by far, the best entry in the dying series.Final Fantasy VI has a majestic character development, taking emotions from all flavors to the game. From people who seeks revenge, like Cyan, or people who was enslaved by the Empire like Celes, the game makes us think what part of life are we living. But the most iconic character I could pick, is the main protagonist, the young Terra Branford.  Amano did a perfect job when designing her, she is the icon of the game. Terra is a very fragile, feminine, but strong woman. She is the hybrid of an Esper and a human, making her a unique being. The design for the antagonist, one of the most iconic antagonist in the entire industry, Kefka, was also brilliant. Kefka is an evil clown who deserves power for himself, even costing the life of many other innocent people, something we don't see everyday in this new antagonists.The gameplay describes Final Fantasy as its total. We play different characters, and the personal skills of each of them, makes the game more creative and unique. Maybe people believes turn-based RPG's aren't the future, but they're totally wrong. Final Fantasy VI's gameplay didn't only stands as a base for turn-based RPG's but makes a revolution of these.Final Fantasy VI is blessed by Nobuo Uematsu, who, in my opinion, composed the best videogame soundtrack of all time. The music is, maybe, the most iconic thing of this game. The title theme, ""Terra's Theme"", is the best piece of music I've heard in my life, composed for a videogame. Many feelings and emotions throughout the game make us believe we are part of the game, something we could want at the time, because this game is for hardcore RPG gamers. In brief, Final Fantasy VI is the best RPG of all time. If you haven't tried it out yet, no need to wait more. The game was released in 1994, next year it will get its own 20th anniversary. We hope a remake for it, as itself stands as the most valuable game of the series, and maybe the only one that could compete as the best game of all time.",KezarHighwind

Many people consider this game to have single handily have saved the single-player RPG genre on the PC just when it looked dead.  It represents a definite turning point in the history of gaming.  This can be hard to appreciate today because even I'll concede that the graphics are dated.  But the truth of the matter is that RPGs have never been about graphics anyway. What made Balder's Gate innovative it was the first RPG to actually use NPCs to advance the story in a mission critical way.  It put their stories, their personalities, their goals on a footing that was equal to your own.  What made it show-stopping was the nature of those personalities.  They were all different, all unique, and they all didn't necessarily care about you.  You had to not just manage combat but manage people if your little band was going to finish the game.Yes, the combat can be unbalanced at times.  There are a few bugs. But if you cannot laugh when Minsc shouts, ""Go for the eyes, Boo"" there is something wrong not with the game but with your life. If you want, you can break this game down and find all it's flaws; they exist. But if you don't cheer sitting in your chair when Minsc shouts, ""Butt kicking for Goodness!"" you have no heart.  This isn't just so much a game as it is an experience. That, it seems to me, is what an RPG is all about. It's about creating experiences; it's about making memories. It's playing your role to the hilt and loving it.  Baldur's Gate might not have been the best, some people argue the sequel is better, but it was the first to offer that immersion in a way no other game had up until that point in time.

I also enjoyed the new Assassin class, which comes with the extremely useful ability to escape with the aid of a temporary decoy, and can use skill tree upgrades that make him a quality melee attacker.noow the time to tell something about graphics last borderlands using cell shaded engine which mean everything like cartoonist now the game using unreal engine 3.every thing in the game is design very well and work on more then 60 frame per second on xbox 360,ps3 and normal pc.if u like the review plz comment about this review thanks.",SUKHDEEP12345

But gave the game a creepy feel to it, and kind of made the game two separate experiences with the same multitude of options to solve each. Overall, I just found this game fun. I've become kind of immune to the FPS craze, and while I've played games like Modern Warfare 2, and all the Halo games, Crysis is still the pinnacle of fun to me. Giving me the option to run and gun, or stand in the middle of a Korean Base fully cloaked. My one complaint, and it is a complaint in most games, the vehicles drive like cardboard boxes. In fact, the only fun I had was with the tank level, only because it was the only vehicle in the game that drove like it should. I definitely recommend this game. Just don't expect to get the highest settings out of it, but know that the game is fun and very playable at lower settings.",JohnS

233,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II,PC,10," Jedi Knight, while 12 years old at the time of this writing, brings back memories of the shooter that did it first. While Quake pushed the limit to what shooters in 3d had been, Jedi Knight made the 3d shooter. It was the first game to make real use of 3d space, and bind it so lovingly to the dark, nitty-gritty, space epic of Star Wars novels from authors like Timothy Zhan. Jedi Knight Jedi Knight, while 12 years old at the time of this writing, brings back memories of the shooter that did it first.

It was the first game to make real use of 3d space, and bind it so lovingly to the dark, nitty-gritty, space epic of Star Wars novels from authors like Timothy Zhan. Jedi Knight was the first major FPS to expand the horizons of gameplay as well, with RPG like elements as you developed your force talents based on your style of gameplay. While the live-action cutscenes are a bit corny, they do a good job conveying the epic storyline that harkens back to the Seven Samurai, except this time the Samurai are evil, and Kyle Katarn must face everyone to get to the man who is responsible for his father's death. Will Kyle remain pure during his quest for justice? Or will the Dark Side corrupt him...the path is up to the player. While the graphics did not hold up well throughout the years, the gameplay still is fast, and the music and sound are spot on--perhaps moreso than even modern shooters. Even 12 years from its launch I would say the 5 dollars on Steam are well spent with this classic gem.",JoshS

250,Dragon Age: Origins,PC,10," I usually don't stop to rate games on review websites like this, but seeing the lousy 8.6 score gave me a bit of pause. I believe that this is far and away the most immersive RPG I've ever played. It is also the first RPG that actually made me feel that the choices I made had real consequences. The dialogue options have a lot of variety and at times I find myself wondering what I usually don't stop to rate games on review websites like this, but seeing the lousy 8.6 score gave me a bit of pause. I believe that this is far and away the most immersive RPG I've ever played. It is also the first RPG that actually made me feel that the choices I made had real consequences. The dialogue options have a lot of variety and at times I find myself wondering what would have happened in response had I chosen something else. The combat system is wonderful, I love the tactics involved. Although the system of pausing and issuing orders makes combat seem almost turn based in complicated situations it also feels more rewarding to me personally after having out matched my opponents on a strategic level. The only real critism I have is that outside of specialization, character customization is a bit limited, there aren't really many important talent trade offs. Any time I make a Tank character it's pretty much going to be the same build or if I make a rogue or archer or healer or mage. I would have liked it more had I been forced to choose talents that would make a more magic oriented tank or more single target oriented damage dealer etc. Maybe I was just looking for a more fleshed out specialization system. Anyway back to how awesome the game is; Dragon Age Origins is definitely a game that I recommend buying even just as a salute to the developers for great game making. Even though I haven't finished the game I already see myself spending hours and hours repeatedly playing it through with different classes and on different difficulties; and even now I feel a bit anxieous that I might finish it too soon and have to dread waiting for a new expansion or sequel.",JohnG

I first played this game as a child many years ago.  I'm now a college graduate and I still enjoy the game to this day.  The thing that I love the most about the Golden Sun series is the story involved.  As you play the game, the lives of these characters unravel before your eyes.  Emotion can also be involved while playing.  Heartbreak from a character's loss of family to determination in hopes of a better future of the world; it's all woven within this game.  Aside from the story, the gameplay is actually great!  As usual with any RPG, you get random battles in dungeons and on the world maps and you progress more and more in levels and skills until you are strong enough to take on your foes without fail.  There are a large amount of items and gear in the game to keep players occupied with upgrading.There is a collection aspect to the game involving these creatures called Djinns.  These creatures boost the abilities and power of the characters in which they are attached to.  They can be swapped between characters to allow for further combinations of abilities.  As characters use the Djinns in battle, powerful summons can be used to take out foes once a certain number of Djinns have been used in combat.  These summons are learned or found throughout the game.The graphics in this game are fantastic for a gameboy advance title.  Everything from the environments to the battles to the summoning cutscenes are all great to look at while playing.  I remember when this game was first released.  I was in awe at some of the graphical effects in this game.  The music in the game is some of the best I have ever heard in a portable title.  I find myself just sitting in a particular battle or environment just to listen to the music and themes that play.  There is a special mode that allows you to listen to all of the music in the game when you enter the arena mode at the title screen (look it up to find out how to find it).  The point is that you may love the music so much that you will want to just listen to it at times.Overall, this game is a classic in my opinion.  The quality of this game is obvious.  I can only hope for a remake of this title one day with modern-style graphics.  It could possibly become more appealing to those who don't like Golden Sun in its current state...",Bszelda

While I like the fact that you can hide bodies, set traps, upgrade your arsenal, and even terrorize your enemies, the level design ranges from good to poor, usually on the bad end of the spectrum. The game constantly you through trial-and-error sections, with the end result of me learning nothing at all and feeling extremely frustrated. Also, the control can be a bit wonky, as sometimes, I'll end up grabbing a body when I meant to pick a lock. And the game loses its appeal once you go through 60% of the game, as you will be frustrated with the fact its basically the same thing over and over but with added traps that are extremely cheap. Also, when you complete the game, you will feel robbed of your efforts. When Mark Of The Ninja does things right, you really will feel like a ninja. However, the sections are few and far between.

When you select your turn-based attack you then have to aim and shoot at juuuuuust the right moment to hit your mark.  If done properly a headshot will reward you with more damage, which makes it worth it to fine tune your aiming.

When your characters level up they unlock very unique abilities, that turn the tides of the shoot out in a flash.As you don't have a large inventory you have to sell off old items as you get new ones, which is frustrating as first.  However, it forces you to jump out of your comfort zone and try new items which will continue to reward you as the game goes on.A touchy subjectThe Ultimate Edition of SteamWorld Heist includes all of the DLC which is great because when you get into deep space, you won’t want the game to end.  Taking advantage of the Switch’s tablet like nature, you have the option to play entirely with touch controls.

Set in the world of A Link to the Past, Link Between Worlds makes the serendipitous combination of a reinvigorating spark with a meaty hit of nostalgia. Presenting freedom of choiceWhat initially looked like a game leaning on the aging crutches of A Link to the Past has turned out to be a thoroughly poignant, vivid and immensely satisfying game worthy of standing on its own two feet. Set in the world of A Link to the Past, Link Between Worlds makes the serendipitous combination of a reinvigorating spark with a meaty hit of nostalgia. Presenting freedom of choice gameplay not seen since the original, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds makes no effort to hold the players hand through the richly dense world of Hyrule  and it works brilliantly. Rather than following in the footsteps of Game Freak and introducing the franchise to a new generation of audiences at the risk of patronising its long term fans, (I’m looking at you Pokémon X and Y) Link Between Worlds pays homage to those of us who have followed Link since his debut over 25 years ago  all whilst paving the way for a reinvention of what it means to make a Zelda game. The puzzles in Link Between Worlds are, as aforementioned, immensely satisfying. I could almost hear the pieces of a riddle snap together in my head as I strived to calculate the answer. It’s a feeling experienced whilst playing the Professor Layton series, but puzzle-solving in this game is made relevant and interesting by the vivid world, close to perfect combat and awe-inspiring imagination. This is a beautiful game, presenting a colourful and vibrant world that just seems to radiate adventure and exploration. The characters are complex and interesting, but perhaps the biggest achievement in terms of its presentation is the silky-smooth 60fps frame rate which stays consistent throughout this 18 hour adventure  even with the 3D effect turned on.",46joey_b

The challenges are nearly impossible to achieve, and require an immense amount of time to achieve.  Needless to say these challenges will give you that great feeling of achievement afterward.  The levels are randomized well, so the experience is rarely the same.  There will be times that you get to skip levels, and times you will be challenged.  There are many different items, an interesting shop (which u can even steal from), and multiple ways to beat the game.

This represents the rapid decline of once great developer am3( Hitmaker) terminating with the horrendous crazy taxi 3. For starters there's no Roddick or Federer, of Agassi and Sampras, though Sampras would apear in later Virtua Tennis games. Then there's the name change from Virtuia Tennis 2 to Tennis 2K insinuating that VC developed the game, as well as the fact that the female players looked considerably worse than their male counterparts, although this is forgivable considering the male models are reused from the 1st game and the short development time and work load. Am3 made VT2 and Crazy Taxi 2, Virtual On Force(arcade) and a port of Confidential Mission all came out in 2001. The cherry on top of this sundae is the terrible season mode. Ditching the 1st games mode where you chose a real tennis player and took on opponents who were much weaker than you in the beginning. Working you way up to the fiendishly difficult Arthur Ashe clone(grand master) while purchasing gear and clothes. Instead in Tennis 2K you create 2 characters, which is cool, except their much weaker than your opponents. Making this burn even worse is you have to switch back and forth to build up their stats making it take twice as long too level up. Agony. Stick with the much better prequel.",chrisx213

There was a part of me though that hoped it would eventually release on the Xbox One and as you can imagine when I first learnt that it was making its way to the Xbox One I was very excited to say the least, and I’m pleased to say that it was well worth the wait. Everything about this game oozes class and charm and to say I enjoyed my time with the game would be a massive understatement. I heard many good things about the game’s story and now I can see why because it’s breathtakingly brilliant from start to finish and the gameplay that accompanies the fantastic story is also flawless. The reason the gameplay is so flawless is because every little different mechanic and aspect adds a unique side to the game. You’ll be pleased to know then that the combat plays a big part in making the gameplay so addictive. Everything runs so smooth when you’re in combat and that means defeating the enemies you face always remains satisfying throughout your time with the game. This is a very good thing because in terms of content the game has a quite a lot for you to be getting on with. The content also doesn’t get boring either because there is variety dotted throughout the game’s fantastic world. In fact the content is that good that my only gripe with the game is that the fetch quests can be a little tedious from time to time, but this is only a small gripe and you can easily look past this. If you’re a fan of big and magnificent boss battles then you will no doubt be pleased with what NieR Automata has to offer. Each boss in the game actually felt like they mattered and the clever design of them meant that fighting them was not only rewarding but it was also very exciting as well. I have to also give a special mention to the presentation side of the game as well because it does enhance the gameplay quite a lot. I know everybody isn’t a fan of NieR’s style when it comes to the visual department, but for me I think it’s perfect and when both the visuals and sound design combine together you end up having even more of an immersive experience.  At the end of the day even though NieR Automata came out last year on the PS4 I still think it deserves a special mention in regards to game of the year this year because quite frankly it’s fantastic. It’s not very often when a game gets everything right but it does here and in the end I can’t recommend this game to you enough.",Xbox_Alive

Inappropriate you say, well you'll think twice as soon as you play this. From the creators that brought you Crash Bandicoot (Naughty Dog) comes a new tale about a young boy named Jak and his pal Daxter who are on there way to Misty Island to meet up with Samos, master of the Green Eco. As soon as they arrive they come across two people named Gol and Maia who command an evil army of Lukers. Jak and Daxter attempt to leave but are attacked by one of the Lukers, Jak manages to destroy the creature with a barrel of Eco, but Jak gets knocked back and accidently bumps Daxter into a pool of Dark Eco which turns him into a orange ottsel (a sort of otter or weasel). Worried and frightened they finally meet up with Samos who explains that only the Sage of Dark Eco can change Daxter back. It's up to Jak and his new transformed pal Daxter to defeat the Lukers and stop Gol and Maia before they can flood the world with Dark Eco. During your journey you will be helped by Samos and his daughter Keira a mechanical engineer (and love interest of Jak) who builds machines of transport to take you to the sage of Dark Eco. Along the way she requires you to find Power Cells in order to powerup her machines. You play as Jak in the game and Daxter assists you with some hints to help you out. You can attack by pressing the square button for a power puch and the circle button for a spin, also there are Eco powers you can use as well. Blue Eco makes you speed up and jump high into the air to reach those really high ledges and Orange Eco gives you the power to shoot enemies. There are puzzles to be solved, tasks to be completed and challenges to accomplish throughout the game. In order to advance further you need to collect as many Power Cells as possible which are not easy to find. There are 101 to find in total. These are found by defeating enemies, accomplishing tasks set by friends on the islands, trading Precursor Orbs and completing puzzles. The journey is a sort of a tunnel like in the Crash series, from one Island to another but it is more free roaming and there are a number of tasks to complete.  Every time you collect one Jak and Daxter will do a dance (like the Crash dance in Crash Bandicoot) which is hillarious. There are some great vehicles you ride which can run over water and lava. Jak and Daxter definitely make a great duo together and Daxter is my favourite and funniest in the game. For those who don't like games mixed with comedy and slapstick should at least give Jak and Daxter a second chance and you may think twice. There are a few problems though in the game. Jak doesn't really have a lot of attack moves and you can't defend yourself, so if there are hundreds at you at once your screwed. Jumping is a real issue at times as well, you can't jump a great leap even by double jumping. Checkpoints are rare and you don't actually know when you've reached a checkpoint until you  die, if you do then you'll start back at that checkpoint and you will have to go through all what you did before. Jak is the only playable character in the game, I would have liked it more if you could also play as Daxter. Despite this Jak and Daxter is a great platform warm up for the PS2 and you will have hours of fun.",Neo010390

I have been waiting for this game and sometimes game’s you wait for don’t always fulfill your lofty expectations, but that’s not the case here because it reaches my expectations and some. The gameplay has lots of little intricate mechanics in play at all times and when they combine together they create a very enjoyable and supremely addictive experience. The world in which these mechanics take place in is absolutely fantastic. There is plenty for you to do and explore on the map and the best thing is that the world felt alive at all times. The content which is extremely important in an RPG is packed to the brim in this game and without a doubt it will keep you occupied for month’s to come. Without a doubt the crux of the game is the monsters that you come to face and thankfully they’ve managed to get this aspect spot on. Each monster has it’s own strengths and weaknesses and the clever design of each monster makes battling them both exciting and challenging at the same time. I will say though that the extreme challenge may put some people off at times, but if you come prepared at all times then you will keep the frustration at bay. I did find myself getting frustrated from time to time, but thankfully that was never down to the combat that’s present in the game. The combat feels great and there are a number of different weapons for you try out and the best thing is that each weapon feels different so that keeps things fresh and interesting throughout. The presentation side of the game is something that I was a massive fan of, especially when it came to the visuals. The graphics look awesome at times and the amount of detail that’s present is absolutely fantastic. The sound design whilst not as good as the visuals is still very well done and it does more than enough to keep the immersion levels high. At the end of the day Monster Hunter: World has pretty much created a perfect experience and in my opinion it will be in for a shout of being game of the year this year. Every little detail in the game has had a lot of love and effort put into it and this makes the game stand out in a very big way and without a doubt this game gets a massive recommendation from me and if you like RPG’s then this game is an absolute must buy.",Xbox_Alive

Seems people are reporting an average of 40-60 hour play times if that is of interest though.So far it's great. As many people have already said, the design is where it shines. The game never tells you what or how to do anything. You begin pushing and rolling sausages to fully cook them around and while it seems like a simple premise, you are constantly learning new things and playing the game in a much different way than you were before so it never feels repetitive. Often I get stuck and then realize, ""Oh wow I can do that?"" While being designed in a way where I naturally stumbled upon it by trying things that seemed possible. I have never thought, ""Oh how was I suppose to think of that?"" You can undo every move you make too so trying new things is encouraged.But don't be fooled by its funny name or silly premise. This is one of the hardest puzzle games out there. Think of something like Snakebird, another extremely hard game that looks all cute and innocent on the outside. Of course I still have much to do so it's just going to get even more difficult.I can see why Jonathan Blow (Braid/The Witness) has cited this game as one of the greatest puzzle games of all time. Alexander Bruce (Antichamber) has given the game high praise as well.The developer Increpare has created English Country Tune and a multitude of other small little games.

With gameplay mechanics that found the magic balance between player skill and character attributes, intricate-yet-accessible character customization (skills, augmentations, weapon customization, limited inventory forcing you to choose equipment suited to your play style), and a strong multi-linear (generally linear plot with multiple routes from start to 3 similar-but-narratively-distinct endings) story that invokes some of the most popular global conspiracy theories of the post-cold-war West, Deus Ex adapted the RPG genre to the FPS interactivity model in a way fans of both genres can appreciate (particularly impressive with respect to RPG fans). The graphics and audio (short loops for ambient sound, rudimentary environmental audio, short soundtrack) are dated, though well-implemented, and the AI scripting is more-or-less the 3-D version of Space Invaders AI (all guns blazing and weave as you CHARGE!), but even today the game is fun and engaging. In fact, despite having played through the story a dozen times or so, I'd gladly shell out another $50 for the same plot and mechanics on a contemporary rendering engine with slightly tweaked AI scripting; I've always wondered why the sequel(s? I haven't checked-up on DX3 recently) decided to mess with a winning formula when they could have kept all of the mechanics and simply made new stories on next-gen engines.

About 12 of them on 2 to 4 player multiplayer games and the rest on single player.Civilization V is an amazing game, but it is not without its faults. The combat system is amazing. The use of hexesHaving been a Civilization addict for about 5 to 6 years I feel like I can give an unbiased review. First off, as of 2 days after the release of the game I have logged 16 hours of play time. About 12 of them on 2 to 4 player multiplayer games and the rest on single player.Civilization V is an amazing game, but it is not without its faults. The combat system is amazing. The use of hexes and the fact that only one unit of each type can be on a hex opens the game up to much more challenging combat as well as unique tactics. However, while the combat system is very nice, the computer never uses any tactics when attacking you. Making defeating the enemies in all situations a cakewalk.The new culture system is also very nice. The removal of religion and civics will definitely annoy some, but the new system of policies is a pretty good replacement. One is forced to plan ahead by timing the construction of wonders, settlers, and military units to coincide with the adoption of new policies. The new method of expanding ones border is also very interesting, a combination of culture and gold. Gold allows to choose what tiles you wish to buy, while culture automatically claims tiles for you. The AI is typically pretty good about picking the best places, but you can always buy up the places you really want if its going too slow. My biggest complaint for this game is the very very very spotty diplomacy system. For a game that was made with the intention of being more diplomatic and AIs are uncommonly aggressive. Diplomacy is now like taking a shot in the dark. You have a good idea of how to lower it, very little idea of how to raise it and absolutely no idea about how you stand with the other nations. In the previous Civ games my favorite way to win was diplomatic victory. Now, having tried for 5 to 6 games and having not succeeded even once, I'm starting to question if its even possible. If someone figures out the diplomacy system, without the use of a guide, please let me know. Another complaint I have with the game is the very bad multiplayer support. You can't save a multiplayer game, only autosave, and the autosave is not very reliable and is prone to self deletion. Having lost 4 to 5 current games with my friends, this is annoying to say the least. Furthermore I have yet to figure out how to play mods on multiplayer, someone let me know when they figure it out? For a game that comes from a long line of epic multiplayer friendly games, this is a huge disappointment. Many of my friends have already said they're not gonna waste anymore time on this game until the multiplayer aspect is fixed. Yet, if you don't mind single player games. Or if you don't mind multiplayer games that you'll almost never finish. I actually enjoyed the single player games and unfinished multiplayers to refine my strategy (But I am an addict). This is the pinnacle of turn based strategy games, and the design of the game itself outweighs most of the negatives that come from stupid AIs, horrible diplomacy, bad multiplayer support (all of which I hope will be fixed by patches). But until they do, this is not worthy of the legacy of Civilization. For now, a 7 out of 10.",Aldunis

Some scenes are just jaw-dropping. The gameplay is also spot on. The controls are responsive (except mousing over keys on keypads), the graphics are sharp, the story is compelling and the characters are interesting. A warning, though: when you first play the game, some things may irritate you, but you will soon see that they make sense. Your inventory size is limited and you often have to leave behind precious things that you KNOW you'll need later. But that makes sense. No matter how much you're enhanced, you're not a pick-up truck. Already, the game makes unrealistic concessions to allow you to tote a bazooka, a sniper rifle, a mini-gun, and crates of ammo through public places without being noticed or even through metallic air ducts without making a sound. You might want to try a Schwarzenegger-like charge through a cluster of enemies, only to find that a single bullet can kill you. Well, shucks. A bullet really CAN kill you. The game forces you to play smarter than the usual shooter. That's a good thing. At first, the hacking just seems arbitrarily frustrating and you might try to avoid it at all costs... until you figure out how it works, and then it becomes fun! The only thing that remains that still frustrates me is that you can't carry more than one of each type of weapon (to sell them). If you have a pistol and you pick up a second pistol, it gets converted to ammo and you're left not with two pistols but one pistol with more ammo. But that's a drop of lameness in a bucket of awesomeness. And yet more awesomeness: you really can play this game many ways. Early decisions have an impact on later events, so you can replay it trying out different approaches and you will see different results. The result is that you'll probably replay it many times, playing the good guy, the bad guy, etc. This might not be a fair comparison, but the nanosuit in Crysis does ""feel"" more powerful than the enhancements in Deus Ex. I wouldn't mind a cross-over where I could play DE using a nanosuit, just to compare. :)",Othrandur
332,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,Xbox360,9,"XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a challenging sci-fi, turn-based, tactical game that assigns you as the commander of a military operation, and the first line of defense against an invading alien menace. With most 'Tactics' style games that release these days being typically medieval, XCOM is a breath of fresh air in the genre. Fans of the original XCOM games released back in the 90's may find thisXCOM: Enemy Unknown is a challenging sci-fi, turn-based, tactical game that assigns you as the commander of a military operation, and the first line of defense against an invading alien menace. With most 'Tactics' style games that release these days being typically medieval, XCOM is a breath of fresh air in the genre. Fans of the original XCOM games released back in the 90's may find this new addition to the franchise a little dumbed down, but that doesn't stop it from being an excellent, solid strategy to challenge all who will bravely defend our wonderful planet.Even on the lowest difficulty, XCOM can certainly provide some challenge to those who may be newer to this type of video game. You start off in command of four soldiers, who each have two moves they can make per turn. Each move can be used for either moving a certain amount of tiles, firing one of two equipped weapons, using one of the soldiers abilities, or simply ducking for cover. The greatest foe in the game is the luck of the roll, as the farther your unit is from an enemy, the lower the chance to hit, but moving in closer will put the soldier at greater risk, and may alert more hidden aliens. Taking cover behind objects on the map can provide you either half cover or full cover, and being smart about when and where you position your troops is necessary, as the game is very unforgiving to your mistakes. The combat can get tense when you fire a shot with an 85% hit chance and it still misses, but with each enemy kill comes a sigh of relief, and with each mission victory, the joy of accomplishment. The easier difficulty settings can help, but later on the difficulty may turn of some strategy noobs. Nonetheless, it's a great system, if a bit more simplified from the original XCOM.Troops that survive more missions and get more kills will level up, allowing you to give them addition perks and abilities. In addition to leveling up, researching and buying new armors, weapons, and other various tools in your base gives the game much customization. You can also build more labs and workshops in your base to decrease research and build times, as well as other faculties for more researching more advanced upgrades.Every in-game month a council with review everything you have done in that time, and provide you with further credits. You can earn more credits by sending up satellites to monitor specific parts of the world. When one of these satellites picks up an alien UFO, a short mini-game will begin, where you send out a Reaver jet to attack and, hopefully, destroy it. Once destroyed, you can explore the crash site, kill any remaining alien survivors, and reclaim further resources for studying back at HQ.In previous XCOM games, the story was deep, long, and memorable. Sadly however, Enemy Unknown's story is very short and simple. The dialog throughout the game is generic and uninteresting, and completing it ends the game, making you either reload an old save or start a new game. The story missions and objectives can be fun, but thankfully you can just keep playing the random missions and shooting down UFOs, extending the game to whatever length fits your fancy.The graphics aren't totally phenomenal, but many of the animations and designs look excellent. Each of your soldiers are fully customizable in appearance, but designing and coloring your units armor requires you to spend extra cash on dlc. Each alien is memorable in both their looks, and the tactics required to take down each one, and each time a new alien is introduced, comes an interesting mix of fear and curiosity. XCOM isn't without it's bugs however, and seeing people shooting through walls, or textures disappear when they're not supposed to can be sadly frequent.For those of you who can appreciate a challenge, XCOM is a decent purchase. It may be simplified in some ways compared to the originals, and the odd graphics hiccup will occur, but it remains a very solid and tense strategy game.Overall score:8.7/10",deathsquishy

On easy difficulty for the campaign, it is very linear. Each mission will take about 15-20 minutes to do and there are aprox. 10 missions. On the other difficulty settings though (medium and hard), if you interact with cetain things in the enviroment, you will be given extra missions. Like on a mission on easy mode, I have 1-4 objectives and about 2-3 other side missions. On medium or hard difficulty, you will have just about the same amount of objectives but up to 3-5 side missions. You can choose to do the side missions for (I think) extra content.Challenges: This is the big playground. In challenges mode, you can do certain challenges for certain modes to unlock new modes and multiplayer characters. You can only have one player doing this, though.Arcade: This mode is where this game shoves it up modern game hineys so hard. This mode is separated in to two parts: Arcade Custom and Arcade League. Arcade League is just like challenge mode except that it has pre-made multiplayer battles. Again, only one play can do this. Arcade Custom is the beauty of the game. You can customize literally EVERYTHING (I mean it too)! Up to 4-player splitscreen can experience chaotic, awesome multiplayer battles on the same screen. What makes this mode so fun is that you can customize: what weapons you can have on the mapthe characters you want to fight againstthe map; game modesYou will have mode fun with this mode than any othe game you will play in your entire life. You can have up to 14 player on one map (up to 10 bots and splitscreen). The bot A.I. actually reacts to the difficulty, and half the time you are fighting, you feel like you are in a actual war.Rating: I really wish I could rate this game higher. If I could it would be a 25/10. Here's why: No game ever in my life have I had this much fun with my family, EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game deserves to be in a Hall Of Fame, because it is a landmark of what so many modern shooters are not today. Call of Duty, Battlefield, Medal Of Honor. These games are nothing compared to this. If you have a PS2, Origional XBOX, or a GameCube, buy this game. This game will show you why so many FPS's are failing today. I can get bored of Call of Duty in about 3 years. I'm still not bored of this game and it's been out for over 10 years.Follow my advice. Buy this game.",bjrob2724

Yes, Ladies and Gentleman, the greatest sports game ever made has the best online netcode the series has ever had in this years game. Finally. Finding matches is a breeze, lag is virtually non existent, and the experience is grand. The remarkably fluid gameplay (grabbing a rebound and taking off with Lebron happens instantaneously and flows like water, no canned animations, so life-like and real), impeccable commentary, and insanely good soundtrack immerse you into the game in ways that cannot be explained. Jay-Z's involvement is felt the moment the game boots up when and incredibly video compiling performance footage (of one of the greatest and most iconic songs of all time 'Public Service Announcement) from Jay-Z's concert with in game 2K footage is so sick. I watch every single time I boot the game up. And I probably always will. I love that track. But the truly amazing thing in this year's game to me, is the inclusion of Signature Skills. Which I think is laying the foundation for another revolution by 2K in the sports video game genre. There are like 50 Sig Skills. Players can possess multiple and the skills have varying ways to effect gameplay. For instance, Kobe, DWade, Durant have a Sig Skill called The Closer. In the 4th quarter, they get a ratings boost across the board and you can literally feel there intensity level go up in the final minutes. Its incredible. Lebron's iconic Chase Down Blocker is one of his Sig Skills and you can see him speed up to reach a fast breaking opponent to get the block. It's uncanny. Others include, Hustle Man, which gives the entire team and energy boost which someone with the skill makes hustle plays. Skills that give percentage boosts or drops depending on situation that can effect gameplay in ways only the deepest players will respect and love equally. For anyone who is a die hard b-ball fan and gamer this is an incredibly deep gameplay mechanic that can only get better over the years once its expanded on. The guys over at 2K Sports are collective enclave of brilliant minds and have the utmost respect of this gamer. This game is the holy grail of Sports Gaming. It gets no better.

The story is exactly the same as before, Rayman is captured and has lost all his powers but his friend Globox comes to the rescue and gives him his power to shoot with his first. During your quest you meet a bunch of new friends, including Ly who is the fairy that restores all of your powers along the way. Your job is to find all the lums, the four masks, break open all the cages and defeat Razorbeard, the robo pirate and main Antagonist of the game. The Henchmen (led by Razorbeard) are there to stop you and there are bosses you fight along the way. In this version however there are many new elements. For starters there is more free roaming and instead of just completing levels, you can also exchange lums for powerups and mini games (for up to 2 players) and tackle challenges in order to gain more life. Most of the levels are still the same but with different areas and there are a few new levels. The graphics have improved a lot, the colours, background and water is much more realistic and you can see the waves and grass moving with the wind. Frame rate is better, you can run around much quicker than on the PS1 version. The voice acting is back and you can have the option to choose between different languages including Raymanian, which is a new feature to the game where the characters supposedly speak in there own language (similar to the PC and DC version). The music is composed perfectly, each theme is right for every level and the sound effects are good as well. There are a few problems I have with this game though. Camera angels are sometimes a pain as you can't always look around depending where you stand. Sound issues i've noticed too can fault i.e. when you use your helicopter or charge your fist, you will hear the noise carry on and it won't stop unless you reset your console. Furthermore although there are some new changes, the game itself is still the same and I personally would have liked it if they could have changed it a bit more. Nevertheless Rayman Revolution is a brilliant plat former for all ages, but if you've already played it's predecessor Rayman 2: The Great Escape and are not really into remakes or improved versions, then you may want to pass on this.",Neo010390

The things I heard the most were the obvious female protagonist and some other innovations, which I don't remember, but I was anyway gonna buy even if it was the sameI was both excited and scared when this game got announced: I'm a HUGE fan of the persona series, with persona 3 being my most favorite rpg, and of course the hype got me and I was literally counting the days for its release. The things I heard the most were the obvious female protagonist and some other innovations, which I don't remember, but I was anyway gonna buy even if it was the same exact game for the ps2. But I can clearly say, this is one of the best rpgs on the psp, if not THE best: the game not only is an improved version of the ps2 version, it also adds a ""new"" storyline with the female counterpart, meaning that the 2 stories, even if the same, are also different at the same time. The game is also very long (I finished in about 60-70 hours, 80+ with the secondary tasks and the additional fusions) which really strikes out considering that most of the rpgs on portable consoles aren't very long (unless you do the additonal stuff...of course). The combat is also very improved, basically taking the best parts from persona 4 (the possibility to control your members, for instance) and still remains one of the strong points of the game, together with the story. My only BIG complains are mostly 2: 1) the game has a very simplified interface outside the dungeon, meaning that you will NEVER control your character outside the dungeon, but only a cursor. I know that they did this in order to make more space for the game and luckily you will still see your characters during the dungeon exploration, and I'm ok with that, but it's going to take a while to get used to it. Luckily the navigation works perfectly: you can move easily anywhere by pressing the Square button (taken from persona 4) and the cursor is quite precise and works good. Overall, it's fine, just too bad that you'll basically never see your character(s) outside the dungeon, especially when there are a lot of costumes to unlock, Also, because of this, most of the cutscenes got cut as well. 2) NO FES! If this game had also Fes (the second part of the game, called ""The Answer"",that roughly lasts about 30 hours), this would be perfect, but unfortunely we only have few things from Fes (the possibility to choose different Stewards, some extra scenes, new persona, etc). Again, probably the lack of space made them cut the additional scenario, or else it would be perfect in all ways. And really, that's about it: the game is the same as the original, with a different interface, but with 2 very well detailed campaigns that aren't necessarily the same: they basically tell the same story with 2 different perspectives and, actually, it really encourages you play twice, doubling the hours and the ways to play the actual game. I personally recommend to try it out if you want a good rpg for your psp (it's a dungeon crawler RPG, the ideal for portable consoles) and even if there are some flaws (it can be slow if you don't install the game into your memory card) it still remains one of the best rpgs on the psp. Must try at all costs.",vahn

That's because, while Nintendo's own portable title largely failed to entice those clamoring for more Metroid, Thomas Happ's indie homage to Samus Aran's adventures is nothing short of a masterpiece.The game begins with a quick story introduction: you're a scientist who went through a mysterious lab explosion and, instead of dying, woke up on a very strange world. You start pretty much helpless, but soon, with the help of a mysterious voice in your head, manage to get a weapon to start things up.The basic gameplay is all classic 2D Metroid: you'll explore the many interconnected sections of the world, all the while looking for power ups to attack and energy, as well as new weapons and abilities that open up previously closed paths.What makes Axiom Verge something truly special, aside from its sheer mastery of the metroidvania formula, is how it differentiates itself with some honest-to-goodness innovative gameplay elements. Almost all of the new abilities you come across refuse to follow the tried-and-true foundations of the genre; instead, they're exciting new solutions to the same gameplay challenges, making the whole thing few extremely fresh.The best idea on display is the Axiom Disruptor, a weapon which allows you to ""bug"" (or ""debug"") certain enemies and structures. Whenever an enemy gets hit with a strong enough blast of the weapon, they will get all glitchy, reminiscent of actual 8-bit glitches from back in the day, and this will change their properties and behavior. This is used in incredibly clever ways, allowing you to solve puzzles, open secret pathways and find collectibles all over the game world.To make everything even more enjoyable, the story manages to be a real highlight (and given how I'm generally quite unimpressed with video game stories, that's really saying something). This is a tale of strange phenomena in a very peculiar reality, and how a scientific mind might react and adapt to them. There are some genuinely touching moments here, with a healthy dose of goosebump-inducing macabre details.If there's something that might elicit complaints about Axiom Verge it's how the game requires absolute dedication if you want to see everything. Some of the more obtuse secrets can be kind of a pain to track down, especially given how the game lacks a quick-travel device. This is kind of a bummer to completionists such as myself, especially since it's impossible to actually get every last weapon in a single playthrough.Lastly, there's one big plus to the Wii U version, and that's the gamepad. Being able to check the map and change weapons without pausing is a godsend, as it allows the game's excellent sense of immersion to remain intact at all times.TL;DR:Axiom Verge is pretty much everything I could ever hope for in a new Metroid game, with the added perk that it manages to absolutely be its own thing. Come to think of it, as a big fan of innovation in games, that makes it even more memorable than a brand new Super Metroid could probably be to me. It's one of the best games of recent memory, and definitely one of the crowning jewels of this generation.9.5/10",ricklongo

406,Dark Souls,Xbox360,10,"Back in 2009, I spent 120+ hours of my life on Demon's Souls, and since then, I have not found its equal.  As dark, challenging, and repressive as the game was, Demon's Souls still managed to feel like a breath of fresh air in the staling game market, throwing back to classic mechanics that were left in the 80s and early 90s with 8-bit, 16-bit, and arcade games.  I find it interesting thatBack in 2009, I spent 120+ hours of my life on Demon's Souls, and since then, I have not found its equal.  As dark, challenging, and repressive as the game was, Demon's Souls still managed to feel like a breath of fresh air in the staling game market, throwing back to classic mechanics that were left in the 80s and early 90s with 8-bit, 16-bit, and arcade games.  I find it interesting that Demon's Souls was far better received in North America than in its native Japan (790,000 copies in NA to Japan's 300,000, many of which were sold after the game's subsequest success overseas), as the game reflects more western RPG conventions and D&D-esque styling than the increasingly common anime-styled games that get labeled as ""JRPGs.""  Dark Souls is a spiritual successor in the purest sense of the over-used phrase.  Its controls are identical to Demon's Souls, yet they are even more precise than before.  The artistic style, starting classes, soundtrack, and multiplayer options are all quite similar as well, but again, they have been tweaked to be a bit superior to that of Demon's Souls.  The graphics are more detailed and crisp than ever.  But the biggest change here is the open-world structure.  Unlike Demon's Souls, which had the Nexus serve as a hub between several more fragmented worlds, Dark Souls has interconnected areas that form one gigantic, seemless world.  It's also at least three times the size of all of Demon's Souls' areas combined, and the zones are still diverse and well-conceived.  The linking of various zones works kind of like classic Metroid or Castlevania maps, where shortcuts to previous areas can be unlocked, making exploration valuable and rewarding to the overall mission.  Instead of the Nexus hub zone, players can rest at bonfires, where they can also upgrade weapons and armor, among other things.  Combat is also enjoyable and very deep, and enemy mobs are more varied than in Demon's Souls.  In short, Dark Souls improves on every aspect of its predecessor, and with the new open-world structure, Dark Souls can easily stand up to the industry's western-developed heavy hitters (like Dragon Age and Elder Scrolls).  In fact, I can honestly say that Dark Souls could steal some serious thunder from Skyrim by offering a more fresh yet hardcore approach to the genre.  I also think that it's astounding that developer From Software could make lightning strike twice - it would have been far too easy for some developers to misinterpret Demon's Souls overwhelming success in North America and try too hard to tweak the subsequent formula to cater to American tastes.  Instead, From Software stayed true to its original form, even deciding to increase the challenge for Dark Souls.  And as one final point, let me also say this:  Anyone who has not tried Demon's Souls or Dark Souls should not let the now-legendary difficulty of the series discourage them.  The challenge that these games offers is not the same kind of hard-for-the-sake-of-hard frustration that some games fall victim to.  Even if you are normally frustrated by difficult games, it's usually because of cheap mechanics and the feeling of having to fight the controls or poor design, and none of that is an issue with the Souls games.  They just demand a little more observation, a bit of strategy and thought.  From Software trusts that its gamers are intelligent, diligent, and skilled enough to handle that challenge, and that's what makes every victory in Dark Souls feel like a real achievement.  The game may not be for everyone, but I would at least encourage every PS3 or XBox360 owner to try it.",JPoppaWUSC

Second, the musical score is absolutely fantastic. I've found myself humming the tunes to myself I don't usually give out lenient scores like this but I enjoyed Cave Story so much that I almost feel obligated to give it a 10. First off, the graphics are what drew me in. yes, they are in the old NES style, however the way they used the colors and designs really are interesting. Second, the musical score is absolutely fantastic. I've found myself humming the tunes to myself many times. Another positive is that unlike in most games today the difficulty is up there. If you make it through the normal ending (There are 3 BTW, bad, normal, secret) you might say to yourself ""hmm... that wasn't THAT bad"", I said the same thing. Afterward though, I found out that there was an even better ending. lemme tell ya, not easy. First you have to go through the game making certain requirements that make things a bit harder. It's the final secret level that takes the cake though. Several enemies and obstacles, and a few boss fights with NO HEALING BLOCKS OR SAVES. yeah... I died a lot XD. Through all this I thought that I would get really frustrated, and I did, to an extent. It could just be me, or it could be some sort of effect from the game but I actually started to get more determined than frustrated. Another quality is the story. Believe it or not, it is actually kinda good. You wouldn't think it would be all that great, being made in reference to the retro days, but it is a lot more involving than most of the classics, not to mention quiet a bit darker. I also found myself caring about the characters. I felt a bit remorseful if something bad happened and very happy when things worked out well for them. Oh yeah, before I forget, One of my new favorite Video game characters is Curly Brace (She's so cute!). The game play is very fun as well. The weapons, the upgrades, and just exploring the world and fighting the enemies are all very satisfying. There are some pretty epic boss fights too. I really like how they used the leveling system with the weapons.You can gain levels by collecting these gold triangles that enemies drop, however if you get hurt not only do you lose health, but weapon experience as well. The game has a good collection of extras as well. You can go through a boss rush mode, where you try to beat all the bosses as fast as possible, a mode where you can try to speed run through the final secret level, and a mode where you can play through the story as Curly Brace (who is still cute btw). I beleive these extra modes are unlocked once you've beat the game (any ending) once but I could be wrong. Curly Brace mode is a bit disappointing, as the only difference between it and the normal story mode is that your character looks different and there's a few changes to the dialog and some extra dialog. I had fun with it anyway, as it's a game that should be revisited a few times if not more. I'd say it will probably take around 5-10 hours your first time through. It may sound expensive at 1200 Wii points ($12) but considering all the content in it it is well worth it. Some may say, ""why buy it if I can lay the freeware version for free"". well the reason is that the graphics, sound, and translation have all been revamped with some nice added on features (And for all you purists out there, You can switch between the new and original art styles and audio). Also the fact that one guy did most of the work and that it's evident that he put a lot of love into making the game helps too.

With all the dificulty settings, everyone can have a good time, from novice to pro players.- Extras: I love the extras, especially the mode where you have to swap fighters, so in the long run, you get to be good with all of them. Still i have my favorite fighter, but i have gotten a lot better with the rest also.Some other good points are you are now able to save everywhere within the game, so you can pick it up as soon as you have the time. Also when i start playing, i can't put the game down quickly, so i end up playing a hour or so!

The colorful Super Nintendo like graphics, casual game play, rewarding selling system, variety of activities to engage in, and beautiful music (especially the fall music) make this game easy to enjoy and lose a lot of time in.

A true challenge even at the easier difficulty settings. Performance is an issue even for today's hardware standards. The game seems to need a fresh system restart to run at its full potential. There are plenty of bugs and glitches. Some were so major that I was forced to reload a save point several times. The game engine and physics is different than most other games, and this takes a little getting used to. The main character's voice acting is pretty bad. Almost to the point of making it sound like a comedy. For whatever idiotic reason, the game alters the Windows audio settings to its liking without setting them back to their original state. This is extremely annoying. Staying in the subject of sound, do a Google search and you will see the massive amount of sound problems people experience in this game. To access the multiplayer portion of the game, one is forced to register and create an account with Ubisoft, which is absolutely ridiculous. The developers clearly reward players who specialize in stealth and skill shots rather than running and gunning. The atmosphere, mood, and setting are superb; providing a tense and exciting experience almost every second of the game. The tension you will experience is not often produced by other games at this same level. There are many parts where you will be spooked and surprised by what comes around the corner or appears suddenly. It is all done very well. Level design in this game is outstanding.

It doesn't strike as ugly, even being over 12 years old now. The sound track still sounds as futuristic as it did back then. After playing first person shooters (ground pounders!) for such a long time, going back to play the game is every bit as challenging as opening the box for the first time. The AI runs circles around your weapons, gets right up in your face at the worst of times, and runs for cover at the best of times. The controls are heavily configurable, and work fantastic with a wireless Xbox 360 controller.The story in the Descent series was never blockbuster level, and while you probably still won't care much in the 3rd installment, at least there's some cut scenes to keep you vaguely interested. The level design and objectives are much, much more varied, having open outdoor areas and not having to destroy a reactor in every level (quite the opposite at one point).Descent 3 (Aswell as I & II) are part of gaming history.

The awful Origin web-based Steam-wannabe launching platform boots me from whatever server I'm in about once per hour. The game freezes and crashes about once per two hours, separate from Origin. The amount of deaths sustained in any 4 hour marathon play session from bugs, glitches, and most notably from hackers requires constant effort to find an enjoyable server. Nothing from EA, Dice, or punkbuster has removed the massive amount of cheating on PC play. Just look at the leaderboards Origin gives you. None are legit.This game was going to be absolutely huge upon release. Everyone knew that. EA was going to make a fortune on this game no matter what, and their preference to take extra net income over spending a few million bucks to make this game work is very obvious. Steam anti cheat has worked properly for many years, as has their delivery system and platform. EA elected not to use that system this time around, obviously to make even more money. The cash grab that is Origin is fine, if it works properly!!! It doesn't. At all. When the gaming community hands you a billion dollars of our money, we shouldn't have to deal with such issues. We should all be talking about balancing issues, new items, new maps, how to further improve such a great release, but the only thing the BF3 forum produces is complaints of stability, complaints about hacking, complaints about bugs, etc. We are far beyond the initial release kinks that every massive selling game will endure. EA's traditional business model of spamming out a game with a higher number behind the title to make more money on the franchise continues, and I won't be suckered into buying another unless I read how stable and flawless the game is 3-6 months after release.",anderson211

A coordinated 8-man team can easily defeat force twice it's since if you are working together. Vehicles play an important role in battle and combining ground, air, and sea elements with your infantry will turn tables very quickly. Every vehicle has it's strengths and weaknesses. A Battleship can take out many destroyers, but will sink if a single submarine finds it, while the Destroyer can take out subs. This rock-paper-scissors relationship can be seen in just about every vehicle and infantry type (or which there are 5). As for the historical aspect, the planes and tanks look exactly the same on the history channel as they do in-game. Depending on the battle and country you are with, you will have a different variety of weapons as well. I also love how the voice commands are written in plain English, but spoken in Japanese, Russian, German, or whatever country you fight for (can be turned off, and there are subtitles anyway). Your history teacher would be proud to see you finally learning what he/she was trying to teach you the whole time. The majority of complaints I hear about BF42 include high system requirements, HORRIBLE admin capabilities for clans who want to run a server, and the in-accuracy of weapons. To that last point, I would add that this game requires more than twitch-reflexes and a fast comp to win... you need teamwork. There is no amount of hopping and ducking that will help you escape a destroyer shelling the beach, or a Panzer tank rolling down the hill. Also, if you unload a clip on full automatic, expect to hit a lot of air, while a smarter opponent will crouch, steady his aim, and fire in 2-3 round bursts. Once you get bored of 1942 combat, there are plenty of excellent quality mods such as Desert Combat (1990's Gulf War) or Eve of Destruction (Vietnam war) that easily make the game worthwhile on their own. IMHO, Desert Combat is to BF42 what Counter Strike is to Half-life.",ATF_Isamu

Nowadays the developers have forgotten what gameplay is and how important it is. Game studios now are as guilty as fast food restaurants making good wholesome produces into more accessible counterparts of half the quality. Yes improvements have been made on next generation consoles to better graphics and a larger game world but the gameplay suffers from what it should be. Remember games like mass effect and the elder scrolls series? This is what people want an adventure where you can explore a world, be who you want, go where you want and do what you want and have some say how it plays out. Replayable games that make you want to try again with a new character. Next generation consoles have made great strides building better larger worlds with better hd graphics but developers have done a terrible job with gameplay and also software bugs which breaks all fantasy immersion and belittles the whole idea of rpg and fantasy.. This game is no different, nice world, nice visuals but gameplay omg boring. Somewhere some development team brought the whole idea of workplace attitude into games it shows. No longer are developers making fantasy adventures with rpg elements and building a story into that to make it that much better they are just copying every other game out there. This game is not an rpg fantasy adventure. I want to be harsh so people are clear on my complaint, this game should be called ""Dragon Age - Revenge of The Halloween Costume Party Scavenger Hunt Team"". Yes, that is how i see this game its an elaborate fetch quest not an open world rpg. This is my critique of a lot of games these days way to much focus on the world design and such a poor idea of what good gameplay is and what gamers really want. We want choices, random loot, a huge game world to explore and consequences play out differently. We want non linear areas, we want interesting lore and creatures, we want game play that will make us feel like in a fantasy world. Certainly we don't want portrayal of real life anywhere. We don't want cutscenes that make us feel we are watching some cheesy tv program nor do we want a checklist of things to look for. We want puzzles and lore to back up the puzzle. So much is missing from this game. Its a drone of every other lazy made game with nice graphics. I can't score it that high.

The single player is a solid 10. It's super fun, immersive and tells a great story... but it's pretty short. The graphics throughout the game are gorgeous, and everything is perfectly fluid.Multiplayer unfortunately is about a 6, which is where you will spend most of your time. You've still got the great graphics, but in terms of actual gameplay it too often feels like a just whole bunch of chaos. War, of course, is chaos... so in some sense I guess that works, but the gist of what you do in every multiplayer scenario is run around randomly until you get killed or see a hint of moment and start shooting. There's sniping and healing, etc... but for the most part you play for a short burst until you get clipped by a random bullet. It's really frustrating when you start taking damage and can't figure out where it's coming from which happens constantly, and if you run around a corner an another enemy appears, skill takes a back seat to luck... what weapon are you carrying and how twitchy is your finger.In Conquest mode, for example, you can choose to spawn on other teammates or certain spawn points, and before you have even turned around or walked two steps you are shot in the back of the head, and forced to respawn again. You might run out of a building and a bomb from a plane drops on your head... respawn again. Spawn in a tank, but the tank is at 10% health and you're suddenly dead again.  And don't forget the enemies can spawn anywhere too... You might round a corner only to have someone spawn behind you. There's nothing you can do but take the death.You will never feel like you are in control of the game or that you can just play better to change the outcome. Nor do you ever feel like winning means anything. You'll continue to play to get more weapon upgrades, but at the end of the day whether you are at the top or bottom of the scoreboard means nothing. Your team feels soooo impersonal.Basically multiplayer feels very ""casual"".... It's really cool to chill and play like you're in a real war, but the randomness feels unrewarding and wins feel unrewarding.Don't get me wrong... Battlefield 1 is a solid 7 great game. But it is far from a 10... It's a war simulator with very realistic graphics and effects. It's multiplayer is fun to play, but begins to get boring due to your lack of control of outcomes and generally unrewarding feeling you have after each match.",corpsed

I wasn’t impressed then, and I’m not impressed now. Destiny caters to the lowest common denominator of gamers by being shallow and repetitive with a big push towards PvP multiplayer. Bungie lost touch with the market and continues alienating fans.I picked up Destiny again just before the Taken King launch. I completed all the original content in about 15 hours. I did most of this solo. The new content adds only 7 or so hours of additional play. If fans bought each piece of content separately—Destiny at $60, 2 DLC’s at $20 each, and the Taken King at $40—they would’ve spent $150 for approximately 22 hours of content. That’s expensive, especially since the add-ons don’t enrich the story. Xbox gamers get less playable content than Playstation owners, but they're being charge the same prices. Newcomers can buy all that for $60. So they get a deal. Long-time fans get screwed. Bungie and Activision seem perfectly OK bending over those who stuck around. Could they at least give them lube?Of course, fans argue that players will spend hundreds of hours replaying it to get better gear. But grinding out gear is insanely repetitive because content is sparse. And despite major plot developments in the Taken King, none of the story elements are cohesive. If players completed TK first and then pursue other quests, none of the plot developments are reflected. It’s like the events never happened. Lazy writing at its finest. Considering Bungie is selling everything as one bundle, they could’ve at least tied it all together.But Bungie doesn’t stop its screwfest at overcharging fans; they also restrict access to this overpriced tripe. How? No matchmaking on raids or high level strikes. Bungie even prohibits gamers from replaying missions at higher difficulties unless they achieve a specific rank. How must they achieve those ranks? By grinding thru raids and strikes with no matchmaking…. Doesn’t make sense does it?So players must seek co-op partners outside Destiny. This locks out a sizeable chunk of the player population from enjoying content they've paid for.According to Forbes, only 20% of Destiny players have completed a raid since launch. That number is low. Despite Bungie’s insistence that raids are too difficult to complete with random players, thousands of people have been doing just that since the game launched. Destiny looking-for-group sites have been pairing random players together to complete any and all Destiny content. And they work remarkably well.The dungeons in Elder Scrolls Online are difficult too, but thru in-game matchmaking, strangers team up to knock those out. But Bungie truly believes Destiny is the most strenuous game ever created. The studio has a big ego, and this was confirmed by Destiny’s Derrick Carroll when he said: “We’ll find you enemies, but we won’t find you friends.” He was emphasizing Bungie's conviction that tactics are so important in Destiny, matchmaking was excluded on purpose to force gamers to play with friends. If a gamer doesn't have friends, they better find some. Bungie believes that only friends are miraculously awesome enough to complete raids. FRIENDSHIP POWER!! What a load of crap.That is exactly the wrong mentality for an MMO wannabe like Destiny. For a game that “emphasizes” teamwork, Destiny does everything it can to isolate players. And all because they believe their content is SOOOOOO demandingly challenging, that a group of mere strangers are incapable of completing it. The fact that the gaming community found its own solutions proves Bungie wrong. The entire philosophy behind Destiny is rooted in fallacious notions and pride. But if Bungie wants to continue paddling against the current, let it. Not every gamer knows 6 people who play Destiny, but apparently Bungie believes Destiny is so amazing, everyone owns it.Anyway, is the Taken King worth the price? Only for new players looking to get a decent co-op experience. Now that everything is $60, the game is somewhat worth it. Borderlands The Handsome Collection and Dying Light are better investments. They offer better customization, more weapons, and flexible gameplay. Plus, Dying Light is getting a huge expansion early next year. Elder Scrolls Online is also a worthy alternative.Until Bungie beefs up Destiny’s social elements by adding things like optional matchmaking, open chat, and trading, I won’t recommend it. Multiplayer could have been Destiny’s saving grace, but it inexplicably relies on the maligned peer-to-peer connections and contains all the problems that system entails. There is nothing forward thinking about Destiny. It’s a wannabe at all levels and the most antagonistic ""MMO"" I've ever played. Despite being the most expensive game ever made, Bungie is average at some things, and below average at everything else. It's a $500 million march into oblivion. And the Taken King does nothing to address any of that. It’s more of the same. Pass",captainkane

The reason I say it’s an understatement is because they have made it addictive without making you get frustrated which is very rare indeed. The game also allows you to have a lot of freedom by offering you a range of customisation options. You can change the levels to how you want them to be which is fun and gives the game even more replay value. Speaking of replay value the game has a huge amount of content for you to sink your teeth into. There is an abundance of levels for you to take part in and each level has a lot of variety, which keeps things fresh and stops you from becoming bored. You will however need to take time to get used to the controls. The controls can be overly sensitive at times and it will cause multiple deaths, so it’s a good job that dying is actually pretty fun. The presentation side of the game really makes the game stand out and makes it unique from other game’s in the genre. The best thing about the presentation is that they’ve managed to combine both the visuals and music perfectly, and by doing this they’ve definitely made the gameplay even better than it already is. At the end of the day I had an amazing amount of fun with N++: Ultimate Edition and with an almost endless amount of replayability it’s a game I will be enjoying for a long time to come. It’s fun with friends and when played on your own, and the variety and level design keeps things fresh and stops it from becoming tedious.

First off, the graphics are vivid and showcase some great detail and the tracks that you race on are well designed and most of them are fun to zip around in your karts. What keeps these tracks from being boring (most of them) is that some are littered with obstacles which are for the most part, are inspired from previous Crash games like the Piranha plants which swallow your kart and spits out its tyres and the rolling toxic drum which squashes you if you're not careful. Speaking of the karts, Naughty Dog has provided some good characters to race with from the Crash Bandicoot Universe (good or evil) like Crash (of course), Coco, Neo Cortex and each have different kart statistics like some can corner more effectively and some are faster in a straight line. The kart roster may seem small (you have 8 karts to choose from at the start), it's still enough for you to dig in and get racing. The game play resembles Mario Kart (which isn't a bad thing. You race around some nicely designed tracks with 7 other kart racers and try to win the race while pelting them with an arsenal of weapons. There's a decent selection of weapons to use like the TNT crate and the homing missile. They are fun to use and it's so satisfying to obliterate your opponents with them. Naughty Dog definitely nailed the game play of this game. It's entertaining to race with A.I opponents or split-screen with your friends. The A.I is smart enough to cause you trouble with trying to keep you from winning by destroying you with (randomly generated weapons, they don't need to drive into weapon crates to get their weapons *sigh*) weapons. They can be a little too easy to beat, even on the hard difficulty setting. The karts handle great and I like the drift boost mechanic where you slide your kart around corners (or on a straight to gain a speed advantage) and press the R1 (or if you're using the R1 button to slide, L1) button at the right time to give your kart a boost (up to 3 boosts per slide) while you turn. This is essential to master this mechanic if you want to beat the best times in time trial mode or get the gold's/platinum's in adventure mode. The controls are perfect and are responsive. Crash Team Racing offers a nice variety of modes to choose from. There's Arcade mode where you can enter a single race for a laugh on a track of your choice with a friend or your own, or a cup where you race on multiple races and earn points on each track depending on where you finish in the race (a bit like a Grand Prix). There's also time-trial mode and versus modes to play. The main meat of the game though is the story mode (known as the adventure mode). What Naughty Dog has cleverly done here, is integrate the level progression from the 2 previous platform crash games (the level selection, the warp rooms) and carried it over to this game. You progress through 5 areas, enter races by driving into active warp vortex's and try to win all the trophies, relics and CTR tokens and gain access to the boss garage at the end of . There are no clear gems to win but coloured gems can be won by participating in a gem cup that can be won by collecting all 4 CTR tokens that are the same colour as the gem cup that you want to enter. Naughty Dog has brought back some memorable bosses from previous Crash games to serve as bosses for this game. Crazy Ripper Roo is back! I love the way that Naughty Dog has integrated how you earn gems, the relics and the crates (the ? boxes which provide weapons and the bouncy crates which in return, juice up your kart and make your weapons more powerful) into this game and it will take a while to beat this game 100% because of all the gems, relics and bonus rounds you have to complete. The music is very well composed just like the previous 3 Crash games but the taunts/ voice dialog coming out of your character and other racers are a little monotonous and just silly. Some of the tracks, although most of them are pleasant to race on, are boring and bland (Coco Park and Blizzard Bluff springs to mind). It's also next to impossible to beat Nitrous Oxides ghosts on all of the tracks in time-trial mode! All of these things though are minor and don't spoil an enjoyable kart racer which maybe an odd concept for a Crash game, but a developer like Naughty Dog has neatly integrated the Crash universe into a kart racing game. It's sad that this is Naughty Dog's last Crash game.",Harry210

TheI was a very big fan of the first Wolfenstein game and I think they did a pretty decent job with it. I did however feel it was lacking in certain areas and it wasn’t always compelling. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus however has took what was good from the first game and made it even better and the best thing is that it was compelling throughout and it didn’t really lack in any areas. The story in the game is stunning and in my opinion it’s one of the best story’s I’ve ever encountered in a game. The characters make the story even better and you can tell that a lot of thought has gone into them and the best thing is that no character in the game feels underdeveloped. When it comes to the gameplay a lot of the mechanics shine through very brightly, and most of them have been done to perfection. I was especially impressed with the gun mechanics in the game and they have managed to make them feel great whilst also making them fun at the same time. The same can also be said about the combat in the game. The combat in the game has a really vicious side to it and this vicious side is both fun and very very satisfying, which is awesome. The presentation side of the game has been done to perfection. Visually the game can look stunning at times and they’ve done a fantastic job of capturing a realistic feel in the locations they’ve used. The accompanying sound design has also been done very well and  each different component gives the game even more immersion. At the end of the day I must admit that I didn’t think Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus would be this good. They have impressed me on all levels and without a doubt this is the best shooter so far this year, in fact it’s one of the best shooters I’ve ever played. Everything in the game just seems to click and you can tell that extra effort has been placed in a number of areas, and this extra effort makes the game a candidate for game of the year. I can not recommend this game enough and for fans of shooters this game is a must buy.",Xbox_Alive

501,NHL 11,PlayStation3,6,"EA has the monopoly in most sports games and it shows. They barely improve their games over the years and not much is done to fix the obvious problems.

It's the realism of hockey they have yet to capture, and NHL 11 unfortunately does nothing to change this. The animations are either too stiff or too relaxed, their movement rarely looks natural. Only the goalie is very well done. The crowd still looks like Sims in Sims 1. They need to improve this. Unfortunately the physics have not improved. Therefore instead of tripping on a fallen player, you simply ""push him"" on the ice. Every time you check a player, it's as if there is a cushion that alters the impact of the hit, and checking rarely is fun to do, you have the impression that you didn't deliver a strong enough hit most of the time. There's some problems with noises and sounds. The crowd will sometimes react over something insignificant while you might do something else that could be the promise of a great play, and there's no reaction from the attendance. I don't understand why they are not putting the real coaches behind the bench. Penalties ( especially when playing against the AI ) are often weird. For example, you will check a player during the whistle, and while the game is stopped, he will chase you without hitting you. Doesn't matter, you both get a penalty over this, even if there wasn't any contact after the whistle. The be a pro mode is interesting, but you quickly realize that the ""coach"" doesn't make his decisions based on the entire team. If you end up moving up or down a line it's only because of what you did, not what the other players did. They need to add a french announcer to Montreal and Ottawa games and they need to put the real songs that are played when a team scores instead of a random song. I know these are very small details, but these details lack in great numbers, and all of them combined remove the realism that most of us are looking for. On another note I would like to point out that EA are greedy as hell. If you buy this game in used form, you must pay to play online. Now that wouldn't be a problem if EA wouldn't shut their servers down a couple of years after the release of most of their games. It's time for EA to step their game up, hire some Canadians who actually know what hockey is and make them recreate this franchise. Right now it looks like a corpse that you keep trying to reanimate and it doesn't look good. For the positive remarks, there are many, many teams to choose from. You can play with CHL teams or european teams, the choices are extremely various. Most of the game modes are fun and well done. Being a General Manager is fun, but it lacks the depth and, especially, algorithms that made Eastside ( a computer game where you'd be a GM ) famous. The songs are all good ones, although some are merely playing in arenas, some other are already famous ( Joe Satriani's song, for example, is often used in arenas in real life ). I kinda wish they could've added some old school stuff like ""We Will Rock You"" and ""The Good Ol' Hockey Game"".",X-Abrupto

On the whole this is a pretty good game that will appeal to a niche market (jRPG fans should take note as this is a step up), but will unlikely find a wider audience given its mechanics and lack of polish.Pros:Turn-based combat that depends on every stat of the character, which is controllable/ determined by you...from who attacks first, who attacks most, through damage, defense, etc. Very satisfying...but takes a while to get back into coming off of the action style games of today.Character customization for the above reasons; allows vastly different approaches to the game.Crafting is strong; again, only if you are into the time it takes to appreciate it. This is another niche appreciation.Story is ok and although the physical footprint is not large, the combination of the above and the planing involved with approaching combat, so as not to be 1-shotted, the game takes 40+ hours to complete (maybe on easy mode it would take less, not sure).While I don't play co-op, that you can fully lay the game co-op is a fantastic feature.Cons:This game was clearly made on a PC budget, from visuals to voice acting this is very obviously not a AAA product (again, much like a jRPG)Combat, at times, can be very unfair. It is far too easy to be 1-shot killed (not just ""you"", your whole party!!!!!) and, in a game with a true ironman mode, that is unconscionable.Rock-paper-scissors is a ridiculous concept to resolving disputes...and I mean ridiculous.Like too many games over the past few years, the games become more complex, but the tutorials do not, so your early enjoyment of the game is much less than it should be...and you lose a lot of people that are borderline RPG fans.Camera angles (top down)/ screen colors are not great and it is fairly easy not to be able to see enemies during combat as they blend into the environment (not purposely)Enemies/ creatures do not re-spawn, so there are only a set amount of xp in this game...once you are ""done"" a section, it is barren (except for the corpses) for the rest of the game...huge disappointment.",Daelus

If you encounter a group of 4 soldiers and take aim, you fire your weapon they spread out and look for cover.  One will fire back while the other 3 will try to outwit you by flanking, throwing a grenade, moving up high, etc.  Having never fired a rifle or been in a fire fight, FEAR puts on screen how I would imagine a REAL gun battle would be.  You cannot charge in and expect to come out untouched.  You have to look for cover and pick each target off one by one while they in turn do the same.  The gun sounds are convincing and just about everything you see can be shot at leaving trails of dust, wall tiles, broken boxes and spent extinguishers.  FEAR is tons of fun.

Each instalment in the series seemed to be better than the previous one and I was very impressed by the improvements they made to each game. In fact I was that impressed that I’m actually quite sad to see the series come to an end, but as you know all good things must come to an end. One of the biggest things that stood out in all of the three game’s of the series was the story and I’m pleased to say that I was very satisfied by how they ended the series. The main reason why I was very satisfied with how the story ended is because all of the previous choices you made mattered and in the end you realise just how important each character was. The story wasn’t the only thing I was very satisfied with because the gameplay has also proved to be brilliant throughout every single game. In fact I think this time around the gameplay is even better because there are new mechanics this time around and thankfully each mechanic performs excellently making the gameplay a very rewarding experience. You’ll also notice this time around that the gameplay is more challenging and at times it can be quite difficult, but even though the high difficulty did make things become a little frustrating from time to time it still didn’t harm the fun factor very much. In fact in my opinion the fun factor has never been higher and I especially found the fun to be very high when it came to the combat in the game. Even though there isn’t much in terms of variety when it comes to the enemies you face it still didn’t hold the combat back very much. Instead the combat proved to be thrilling from start to finish and that’s mainly because the strategy elements included in the combat sections have been done to perfection. Another thing they do brilliantly is that they make the combat sections feel important at all times and in the end you really do feel like your shaping the characters destiny when locked in battle, which is great. Once again the presentation side of the game stands out in all areas and that has been the case throughout the series. Both the visuals and sound design enhance certain elements in the game and when they combine together it’s a treat for both your eyes and ears. At the end of the day if you’ve followed The Banner Saga series from day one then you’ll be pleased with how the series comes to an end and as far as a collection of game’s goes this series is up there with some of the very best and if you’ve never played any of the game’s before I fully recommend that you do.",Xbox_Alive

The game also allows the player to pick different routes which lead to alternate endings which increases the game's replayability. I have recently purchased the Tactics Ogre game for PSP, which is a remake of the original because of my love for this game. I am sad that these type of games don't have a much of a place on consoles anymore because of a niche market - but I am happy that Atlus continues to develop these games.

This is a sword, this is a gun, these are monsters. It has an almost cartoony look to it but the gear still looks badass enough so that it doesn't get annoying. As far as the skills are concerned i think they both are tied. They have different styles but TL2 is more pleasing to the eye. It isn't bright to the point that it is annoying but enough so you can clearly tell what everything is and the action doesn't blur your vision to the point that everything kind of melts together. (as it feels like it does sometimes in D3). As far as physics are concerned Diablo 3 definately wins. Crumbling stone, Monster gibs are very satisfying, and the environments almost falling apart in some areas really adds immersion to the gameplay. The models in TL2 look like they had a little more love put into them. The swords aren't flat and dont look paper thin, And the wide variety of ranged weapons for mostly one class really impressed me.Monsters: The monsters in diablo felt generic, uninteresting, and just plain bland most of the time. Mostly borrowing from the previous games and adding a few from other games it really didn't bring any surprises. Even the bosses felt kind of boring with the butcher being the generic bad guy from about 10-20 different video games including previous diablo games. The champions in TL2 have been greatly improved from the first one but after playing d3 for so long they felt like pushovers. While some people may have been disappointed with how simplistic the champion design is i was actually thankful i didnt have to spend 30mins-1hour fighting one champion because my gear wasn't godly at the time. I was also thankful there were no invuln minions, reflect damage, mortars, desc, or the ice bombs. Because it meant i didnt have to hop around the map trying to sneak a shot in time from time while trying not to get killed in 1-2 hits. Overall TL2's champions were slightly not challenging enough (i played on veteran) and D3 was too unforgiving. Gear: Here is where TL2 truly shines. Gear is plentiful, and gear of all rarities are useful with uniques being rare enough and with good enough affixes that it would immediately replace the rare gear you had before without making you feel like you NEEDED it. It took me 3 uniques until i got one that i could actually use so i stuck the others in my shared stash for alts and didn't find myself disappointed that i didn't get more. The rare and uncommon drops had good enough affixes, and all useful for my class so i didn't mind not getting godly gear. In diablo 3 had i gotten gear with strength or intelligence (focus in tl2) i would have been pissed and vendored that !@#$, but in TL2 some strength or focus is actually useful for my mostly Dexterity class. They balanced the skills so that every class can benefit from bonuses in each of the 4 stats. And if you dont like certain affixes on your gear you can pay some gold and get them removed via enchanter, and also add in more enchantments depending on how good the enchanter is. This allows for great customization in gear and makes almost every rare or higher drop worth keeping. In diablo 3 getting gear feels like cycling through garbage for hours or even days to find 1 hidden diamond.I've seen people complain about TL2 interface but honestly i found it to be much simpler and easier to understand than D3. It has no hidden modifiers, any additional information you want to know can be found in your arcane statistics (J). Plus you can load your pet up with any loot you dont want and he will go to town and sell it for you so you can spend more time actually playing the game.Basically if you love to grind and spend hours upon hours praying to find something godly, or even worth putting on the AH; then play D3. If you like to play ARPGs and kill monsters, get lots of loot, and have a ton of fun; then play TL2",unlimitednk

The game run terribly for a lot of people (if not everyone) even if you have a good rig. I have a GTX 970, i7 3.4ghz, 12GB RAM. I could even turn all of the graphical settings to the absolute bare minimum and even though the game looks ugly it STILL would not run completely smoothly and would have FPS dips. Also, every time enemies are triggered there are awkward ~3 second pauses which ruins the flow of things. This is the worst problem for me because it affects your enjoyment of everything.2) Line of sight issues. Some walls, floors, and roofs in the game do not properly block line of sight. This is especially evident in the urban city maps when you are trying to be on roofs. Firaxis should not have release the game with these issues in place.3) Chrysallids aren't the only bugs that will make you have a bad time. The game has numerous bugs and glitches. Some are as bad as completely ruining saves SO DO NOT TURN ON IRONMAN MODE (just do honest man instead). Others include animations not playing, damage numbers not showing, and etc.4) Some questionable/bad design choices: For example, you'll get voice over messages from a person during missions. He will say the exact same thing every mission and he says these things very often and the whole time he's talking you aren't allowed to do anything. So you have to sit there waiting, doing nothing while he says the same thing you've heard him say or the 20th time. Another example, the new HP bars are inferior to Enemy Unknown.5) Debatable: the music is worse than EU. This is of course subjective and some people think the music is good or is fine, but I'm pretty sure more people would agree that EU's music was superior.6) Debatable: the majority of missions involve timers or scenarios that force you to rush/run and gun. I'm on the fence on this issue. Some people say they're fine and people need to ""git gud and not rely on overwatch crawling"". I agree that XCOM should be very difficult and the  round limits did make for some exciting escapes. I think though I would've preferred that instead of the vast majority of missions being about being fast and praying you don't trigger 3+ pods, that there be more missions with more lenient timers but with some other kind of difficulty that isn't rushing against the clock.The Good:Aside from the above, the game improves on EU in most every other aspect. The game could've been a real work of art if it didn't suffer from these issues.",Trypsinogen

But at the very least I will say, yet again, I still liked it. If it had been a DLC, I would have scored it a 8.5 out of 10, but since it was released as a package, I have to grade it the way I see it on the whole.I would recommend this  to anyone who hasn't played the game yet, but if you do, don't bother with XCOM: Enemy Unknown.Side note to Firaxis:I am a little disappointed in you. I expect this from Capcom, but not you. I hope you are working on Terror from the Deep, but don't do it like this again.

556,Call of Duty: Black Ops,PlayStation3,4,"Hello there, I felt compelled to write my first review of a computer game after playing Black Ops, for reasons that will become clear. To set the scene I'm 29 and have been playing computer games since I was about 8, i love FPSes and all sorts of other genres but particular favourites are CoD, MOH, and the Battlefield series which I play on the Ps3 and PC. I was looking forward  to BlackHello there, I felt compelled to write my first review of a computer game after playing Black Ops, for reasons that will become clear. To set the scene I'm 29 and have been playing computer games since I was about 8, i love FPSes and all sorts of other genres but particular favourites are CoD, MOH, and the Battlefield series which I play on the Ps3 and PC. I was looking forward  to Black Ops for a variety of reasons but mainly because I wondered how MW2 could be improved upon and I thought MW2 was pretty darn good. I held off buying MOH as I thought i'd go for the old favourite having played CoD on both systems since its' inception. I felt it right to try and wrtie an evenhanded review of this game in order to assist anyone wondering if they should fork out their hard earned cash for it.  I forced myself to play to Level 19 so I could experience Hardcore mode (which was annoying to say the least to have to 'earn' that) and I played the single player campaign on veteran. I have played the game for 21 hours.Single Player: The graphics are atrocious. They remind me of some of the worst elements of the graphics on MW or perhaps earlier. There are various parts of the compaign that ...simply put....dont work. For instance in the cuban villa, a guard wrestles a 'baddie' over a railing. Hang on, go back, if i run in a little earlier they magically appear in front of me. In addition, I stab a guard hitting a man on the ground in the jailbreak, the man on the ground continues to flail around and then disappears. such obvious but joy-undermining flaws are abundant. Let it not be said the campaign story is not immersive if a little trite. What it fails to do is harness the basics, it does not feel like you are in a fight, it does not feel like you are firing real bullets and it does not feel like the enemy are clued up. In addition, whomever had the idea of your two buddies being bullet proof through a shower of bullets needs to check the definiton of 'realism'. How could this be fixed? I am not sure, but I would suggest that not having key characters indestructible would be a good start. Now I have to say, to be fair the guys at treyarch did get one important thing right: if you stand on a grenade your leg gets blown off. CORRECT. This type of realism is a blessing and something that should be echoed hereafter. Not since F.E.A.R have I felt that a programmer has attempted to harness 'gore' in such a way. That is something that all other FPSes so far fail to acknowledge or accomodate. However, if this is at the expense of the graphics, textures etc then perhaps it is too early, as in CoD:BO (sorry). Multiplayer: I guess that if i was 15 and loved to run around with an SMG spraying the crap out of people, or drive a tiny car that exploded this would be the game for me. Perhaps somewhere along the line I grew up (although my gf would beg to differ), or maybe CoD and in particular Treyarch didn't. What we have here is a lot of guff that will amaze the teenager in you, but for the old hands, will probably wear off in the first 6 hours of gameplay. This is of course, not an in-depth review (although some of the 'in-depth' reviews I have read should be more appropriately titled ""What I Loved About CoD: BO, being as they appear to ride roughshod over the very obvious and 'epic' failings of  the MP structure)., so I can only say the following. 1. The maps are tiny 2. The graphics are even worse (compare to BFBC2 for example)  3.The upgrade system is interesting but ultimately gloss 4.The modes are no different in essence to Mw or Mw2. There is nothing of substance here that could genuinely be called 'groundbreaking' or indeed 'new'. Add to those complaints the connectivity delays, the sudden closure of a server and reboot within another, the appalling sound, and the general lack of detail and what you have is a glossed up version of MW2 without any of the glorious detail or depth.Some other things that annoyed me:This cost me Â£39.00. not a fortune but relatively a lot of money, and what I feel like I purchased was MW2, that had been actually stripped down of its essential detail, to be replaced with gloss but no substance. It feels like a remake for a lower budget and it feels like a rip-off. The term 'expansion' springs to mind. I accept that the audience to which this game is sold is far more likely to be about 15 years of age and into the run-and-gun modes. I also accept that is where the money is, and that this game has its positives, but they appear to be so limited in imagination that I feel like I have stepped into 'Arcade CoD' and after 21 hours played I want to get right back out again. I had the night booked into my Ps3 to play online with some mates and at 20:30 I turned it off and came on here. That is how annoyingly bad, unimaginitive, and, it pains me to say. un-CoD like this game is. In summary? Save your money and  avoid gushing reviews.",M3chaGr4n

I like the new deep franchise, and having the extra gameplay modes (especially impressed with the unlockable herritage classic), but there's a few things that really should be fixed by now. My wishlist for next year is seriously long. The graphics could use an overhaul. While the faces look great, the animation and whole look of the players are below par for games today. Players are all hunched over and have the same skating stide when going slow as they do when skating fast. It just looks unnatural. The commentary is relatively weak this year too. They make the same dumb comment about a team every game - it's just painful when you're playing through an 82 game season in franchise mode. It's also still apparent that these announcers aren't hockey fans. They mispronounce a remarkably large proportion of player names. They also still call offside, ""offsides"" - which is just ridiculous (they did the same thing last year and the year before - you'd think someone would let them know). Although the addition of the custom soundtrack is appreciated, they managed to forget to include a random track option. So if you put on say 20 tracks, it'll just start on the beginning track every time. I really don't like hearing the exact same song start up whenever I go to a menu (for example). The line editing and stat tracking is exactly the same as last year... which is to say it's unintuitive and ugly. The skybox isn't nearly as cool as in espn nfl, although i like the new unlockables available there. The presentation isn't up to espn nfl's level either. A simple thing like the unsmooth camera movement off the faceoff really make a difference in overall look. I also seriously wanted a sportscenter highlite reel like espn nfl had this year. There's a few gameplay quirks too. An example is that when you select auto line changes, it'll literally never pick the 4th line. It'd be less offensive if the manual line changes had better control. While I am a bit disappointed with the game overall, I'm still a fan of this franchise. ",Uter

So far, this hasn't been true, until now.

I've always thought the excuse 'Hey that reviewer gave that game a negative score! He should be reviewing this game in the context of the expectations set by other portable titles' shouldn't hold true for the vita, so THANK YOU little big planet vita for proving this. Not only is little big planet ps vita a great conversion of a console title, it actually improves on the existing formula by adding some seemingly minor changes that definitely benefit the game in big ways. Things like the saveinator that allow you to make games where the players can actually save their progress through your game is a little edition that brings huge possibilities with it, so not only can you make quick arcade like experiences now, but you could make a full fledges rpg game that takes 10 hours or more to complete! The new vita specific touch, tilt, and rear touch functionalities are surprisingly a lot of fun as well, and the ability to take a photo of anything and upload it to your level (Don't worry I haven't seen any penis filled levels yet) is a really fun edition. Oh yea, and unlike the psp lpb this game has online multiplayer, and it works really well, pretty much any level can be played with someone else, well, except for the levels that the creator has specifically made as a single player level. There are a couple of things that could make it better however; it would be nice if you could play miltiplayer with ad-hoc, and wouldn't it be cool if lbp ps vita was able to play the existing games available for the ps3 titles? But this game does way to much good to make those few things even matter. If you have been on the fence about the vita, YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME! I really hope an awesome community forms around ithis game, because it definatley deserves it. Its a wonderful game that honestly makes little big planet feel like it was designed with the vita specifically in mind. I'd write more praise for this game, but I need to get creating.

Since the PS1 release of the first Ridge racer, I have been a fan of the series and it is always interesting at how each newer version of the game changes radically from the last.The main talking point at the release of the PSP / and this game was its graphics and the speed that this small portable system can put out - and rightly so...  no problems at all in that court.Being an arcade game, there are little to no instructions-  race, drift around the corners to increase your boost bar, and then use the turbo to go ... faster....Controls are fairly decent, until you drift around a corner.  The most remarkable thing in the RR world is when you can drift around a left corner... whilst TURNING RIGHT! ...  I dont mean like that scene in the pixar movie, ""Cars""- but... you can, drift around a left corner, skidding to the right?!? - the drifting in the game unfortunately seems to be based on a ""roller coaster"" so little to no feeling is apparent. - until you actually realise this, the game is damn fun though!  - it is a shame though, and it looses points for some race-lovers who like to race normally by using brakes and a grippy tire system (as done in the early RR series)There are many stages in the game, or ""series of races"".  each comprising of around 3-5 races.  There is only a small number of tracks, taken from other versions (from PS1, PS2, Xbox360 etc) and they are flipped, reversed, and so on.As soon as you complete a stage you automatically get awarded a set of cars... which seem to be almost identical to the car you were just racing.  It ended up becoming a chore just watching these segments in the end (similar to a loading screen)Verdict: On the whole, this is a very entertaining game, until you realise that you are just repeating yourself by playing the same tracks over and over. - oh and until you see the ""rollercoaster"" drifting system at work......Oh, and ... If you have a choice between this and the PS3 version... GET THE PS3 ONE!!!Pros:FastNice graphicsA lot stages to beat!Cons:Lack of feeling whilst driftingWin a car after every race, ...

It’s a game I’ve heard lots of good things about from some of my friends who’ve played it on the PS4 so I was really looking forward to getting to grips with it. Thankfully my friends got it spot on because to say I enjoyed my time with the game would be a massive understatement. Something that really makes this game stand out is its story. The story is absolutely fantastic and manages to stir a whole host of different emotions along the way and this culminates in making the story stay with you long after completion. The gameplay that accompanies the fantastic story was also enjoyable, and I must admit that I was especially impressed with the puzzles that were implemented. They’ve done a fantastic job of making the puzzles in the game matter and the clever design of them makes completing them a very enjoyable affair. Something else I enjoyed about the gameplay were the battles that took place. The combat may be a little on the basic side but that didn’t stop them from being very immersive and most important of all it didn’t stop the battles from adding to the already amazing story. You will notice however that the game suffers with a few technical issues every now and then when in battle, but thankfully these issues don’t happen very often and don’t affect the gameplay very much. This is a good thing because it allows you to enjoy the enemies in the game without too many problems. Speaking about enemies the game offers you a decent amount of enemies for you to tackle and the best thing is that each enemy has a decent amount of variety implemented into them. I found this to especially be the case when it came to the bosses in the game and to say they were exciting throughout would be quite the understatement. Without a doubt one of my favourite aspects about the game was the presentation side of things. Visually the game looks absolutely stunning and when you combine that with the absolutely brilliant and immersive sound design and voice acting you end up having a very memorable experience. At the end of the day I’m very pleased that Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice made its way to Xbox One and trust me when I say that it was worth the wait. The game tackles a number of real-life issues in a fantastic and delicate way and by doing this they deliver to you a very unforgettable experience. Another thing that impressed me with the game is that it doesn’t suffer with many problems at all and every aspect of the game has had a lot of thought and effort placed into it and because of that the game gets a massive recommendation from me.",Xbox_Alive

But don't take my word for it...Quick question: What do God Of War, MGS, GTA, Final Fantasy, and all the other games that are rated higher than this one have in common? Answer: All of them are part of a franchise that was already massively successful, before a new episode was ported to the PSP.As one of the few people who tried the PSP versions of the new franchise episodes with fresh eyes, from not having played almost any of the previous instances from these series on any other platform, I can't help but find that scores are massively biased. God Of War, GTA, FFVII, Persona 3? Meh. MGS? Will never come close as its first instalment on PS1. The only title from an existing franchise actually worth its place around the top on PSP is Ridge Racer. If critics were actually objective, all the others would be much lower rated.But let's also compare with non franchise games: Lumines better than Jeanne D'Arc? Not a chance. The Lumines guys haven't spent 10% of the development time that went into Jeanne D'Arc, and, as addictive as the game may be to some, it shows.Siphon Filter: very good game, which deserves a lot of credit for managing to be highly playable despite Sony's idiotic lack of insight with regards to the second analog stick. But still a bit too predictable and not as polished.And then you get all the stuff like Patapon, LocoRoco, LittleBigPlanet, etc., that tries so hard that it actually gets into the way of the gameplay.Sorry, but this game is miles above the rest, graphically, story-wise and in terms of playability and, what matters most, enjoyment for players.

The long-requested arcade mode is filled with nostalgic detail, and it gives offline players a compelling reason to keep fighting, something that the original release was sorely lacking.  New V-Triggers will undoubtedly shake up competition online, and while there are still a few classic characters missing from the roster, the selection we have at the beginning of Season 3 is still fantastic on its own merit.  If you've never played Street Fighter V, this is the perfect time to jump in, and if you already own the original, there's absolutely no excuse for not downloading the free update and giving it another chance.

The main character himselfThe one qualm I have with this game is how many will regard it as inaccessible, and if you're wondering if this game is for you, I suggest reading the last paragraph of this review.The storyline has its quirks that are hard to swallow, incorporating a dense amount of memes from the fringe cultures of Akihabara/Japan and the stranger parts of the internet. The main character himself suffers from a childish delusion the Japanese label ""chuunibyou,"" or ""8th grade syndrome,"" and many readers will take some time to adjust to it. The time machine central to the plot is also banking a lot on the reader suspending their disbelief in that it could be created at all.Those that do penetrate deep into the story will find that the story is able to turn these quirks into strengths. Over time, we're able to laugh at the ridiculous aspects of these fringe cultures the main characters are obsessed with. Particularly, the story also takes great care in approaching the time machine. Their stringent application of justifications for, and limitations on, the machine both work well within the plot and help it stay within the realm of belief. The main character deserves a special mention, especially for the track record main characters tend to have in visual novels, even amongst the ""serious"" ones (like S;G). The character's ""8th grade syndrome"" goes from bizarre to endearing, and floors us when we realize the gravitas of him adopting (and later shedding) this habit.Once the story is fully underway, we go through a series of acts that all embody a different problem under common themes. We find out that a calamity will befall the human race, and that we bear responsibility in bringing it about. At the end of these pivotal acts, the game asks us if we're ready to sacrifice the emotional progress we've made with our friends, if we're ready to undo the progress they make against their own sad fates, for the good of many more. We find out that even when we seem to take steps in the right directions, we may be making things worse.Beyond its core philosophy, there's also a certain level of mystery to the visual novel. There are many details and hints that we're encouraged to look out for, such as ""Who is John Titor, and why did they appear in year xxxx?,"" ""How will Y's strengths influence the plot?,"" ""At what point did I notice Z happening?"" Those of us that continue asking ourselves these questions and keep our observations in mind will find themselves very satisfied with the plot, for how it rewards our vigilance and how it also seems to have thought through (almost!) every possibility.Regarding length, be aware that it took me 32 hours to reach my first ending (the first available ending in Chapter 6 out of the 10). Total time to reach and read through each of the endings, all the way until the ""True"" one, was about 54 hours. The length is both the bane and boon of this game, as many will want something they can blow through quickly (if this is you, find a guide and search the instructions for going through the True route). For those that play these games to lose themselves in another world and grow so close to the characters that they begin to feel like actual friends, this is a must play for you. I highly recommend that completionists save the True route for last.Accessibility is my main qualm with this series. As I mentioned earlier, the main character and story will be hard to adjust to if the reader is not well-acquainted with the fringe culture it draws from. The main character's childish delusion, or ""8th grade syndrome / chuunibyou,"" isn't as commented on in Western culture as it is in Japan. We're familiar with the concept; the strange mixture of unjustified self-confidence born from the delusions of a middle school kid too deep in fiction to tell the difference. That said, it can be JARRING to see that our main character is 18 years old and exhibiting the same behavior, and how it reflects in both his dialogue and inner monologues. The references to 2channel (or @channel in the S;G universe) will be lost on many, and the particular language exhibited on there can be either confusing, offensive, or alienating (many references to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure ahead). In short, your mileage here will vary greatly. The story does do a good job of keeping us hooked, but I'd be lying to say that many readers from a broader interest group won't have to drag themselves through the first few chapters. JAST's translation of the work is FANTASTIC, though, and if you don't want to take the short cut to experiencing Steins;Gate (by watching the anime), I do recommend experiencing the visual novel for its 40+ hours of nail-biting, emotional, philosophical glory. Also, many will see the references in S;G to an earlier work, called Chaos;Head. You do not need to have watched C;H to enjoy S;G. In fact, I highly discourage watching C;H because, frankly, it's a trainwreck and will only tarnish your expectations for S;G.",Vivifyingly

646,Crypt of the NecroDancer,PC,9,"I have 125 hours play time in the early access version of Crypt of the NecrodancerCrypt of the Necrodancer is a marvel of a game in concept and, most importantly, execution. A turn-based dungeon rogue-like with permi-death that requires only directional keys and is designed to be played on a dance pad. The beat of the music provides the time for each turn as the player make their wayI have 125 hours play time in the early access version of Crypt of the NecrodancerCrypt of the Necrodancer is a marvel of a game in concept and, most importantly, execution. A turn-based dungeon rogue-like with permi-death that requires only directional keys and is designed to be played on a dance pad. The beat of the music provides the time for each turn as the player make their way through the crypt. Cadence and others will have access to an array of weapons, armors, spells and items to help them battle the various monsters and bosses. Necrodancer is tough but fair.While the mechanics are simple, the game is challenging. Each enemy has an attack pattern that allows even the weakest of weapons (base dagger) to defeat them. How you clear a room will be based on knowing the patterns, prioritizing enemies. and adapting to the items you have while maintaining the beat. The minimalist controls and over-head view give the player maximum control of game play. If you die (and you will... a lot) it will be the players fault. To this end, the game provides a training ground to test any combination of character, weapons, and monsters, so the player can hone their skill.Necrodancer has a lot of replay value. The zones are procedurally created and items are randomly found via purchase, opening chests, creates, and barrels or through the use of shrines. So every game is different. There are 10 playable characters providing addition variety. Cadence is the base character, but you can also play her grandmother, Aria, who dies whenever you miss a beat and cannot upgrade her weapon. Monk dies whenever he picks up gold and Bolt plays at double speed. If one finds all of this to be too difficult, Bard ignores the timer, allowing the player to dance as slow or as fast as they wish.The game is viable for casual play, speed racing, or score running. And, as stated, is perfectly suited to be played on a dance pad.The great music was composed by Danny Baranowsky (Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy). And the game includes 2 remixes provided by A_Rival and FamilyJules7x. Furthermore, you can import mp3s into the game and play to almost any song you desire. You can also create your own maps as well as customize and re-skin any of the sprites.Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rare game that is challenging, fun, and open to a multitude of playing styles. I thought the game was worthwhile before the final release which added another zone, some new bosses, a story, and 2 additional soundtracks.",Crowrevell

This however is the first that lived up to the high expectations that first season gave me. One thing that helped that out a lot for me was that for the first time this season I was finally with a group of characters all of whom I genuinely cared about. There weren't any bland or faceless ones whose fates I really couldn't care about.The episode is also filled with shocking, emotional, and dark moments constantly throughout, one after another. I remember there being some scattered complaints about last season's choices not mattering in the final episode, because everyone worked up to the same ending. That isn't the case here. This episode will push your ability to make tough, heart-breaking decisions that effect how the game concludes. There are multiple endings, and it's up to you who you align yourself with. If season 3 of the game continues with the story of Clementine, then my season 3 could end up looking VERY different from your season 3. Here's hoping that's what happens.All around it's the best episode of the season. For me it's the first that lives up to the masterpiece that was the first season, but regardless of whether you loved this season just as much or more, I'm pretty confident you'll agree that this is the best of the bunch. This episode confirms that this is my story, and that I was truly in control of where Clementine's life went. For the first time in a Telltale game there's no set ending, so each of the unbelievably difficult decision that literally has you choosing between characters you care about multiple times have much more wait than ever before. That's what makes this episode such a masterpiece. My total score is a 9.3/10.",TheQuietGamer

The portraits are great, but the sprites are lazily low-rez. All of the new features are things that modern SRPGs not only have, but have advanced upon further making Tactics Ogre still feel 2 steps behind.What killed the game for me is the pace. The game is easily 40-50 hours, but to be honest 20-30 of those hours could be removed if battles weren't so slow. You have low damage, low chance to hit, and the board is flooded with enemies. It can easily take 4-5 hits (assuming you hit with 40-60% chance to hit) to kill one enemy. The trajectory system also drives me nuts. 9/10 maps the enemy is given the high ground, making it very easy for their archers and casters to hit you. Having the low ground you're going to constantly hit your own units. What's the point of having a knight protect a wizard if the wizard is just going to keep hitting the knight in the back?There's also no real alternatives to grind your characters to speed it up.Ultimately I started questioning why I was playing the game when I could play something like Disgaea 4 or Fire Emblem: Awakening instead.

The atmosphere is also well-done; most of the game having a spooky paranormal aura about it. The puzzles are good and some are pretty clever, they're not too hard to figure out but there's a very well made hint system to help you if you happen to get stuck. Some parts of it are very morbid and all-around messed up, but that adds a lot to the paranormal atmosphere. The soundtrack is amazing, as well as the ambient sounds and sound FX in general. The special FX are also top-notch, pulling the game together with a very professional feel and look.Even though Year Walk has many pros, it also has a handful of cons. For starters, the map is kind of mislead, it's hard to know where you're going without checking the map every time you enter a new screen (but at least they included a map), also some of the puzzles are kinda not obvious, like you're supposed to know to chase a woman down through the woods when you didn't really even know what happened during the confrontation with her. Also, with Year Walk being a horror game, and I stand by my ideals strongly with this, horror games really demerit themselves when they utilize the dreaded ""jumpscare."" And Year Walk has a few of these, and they're totally out of place since Year Walk already has an amazingly paranormal and spooky atmosphere and strange feel about it, why throw in some cheap jumpscares and make it more like all the other mainstream horror games like Slender?Throughout Year Walk there's quite a few puzzles you need to remember a good amount of information for, so I had to actually write them down on a pad of paper, so it may be useful to have one around. Some of the puzzles are unimaginative, as well as Year Walk having a few graphical glitches, such as the ground disappearing (which happened to me in the cemetery).But overall, Year Walk is very ominous and foreboding, with amazing special FX and a fantastic soundtrack, and despite the fact that it's not sure what genre it wants to be, and the story being heavily incomplete/unexplained (and I know it's trying to be ""mysterious"" but it almost feels like the creators didn't have the story completely fleshed out so they avoided details), Year Walk is a pretty decent game. It was a toss-up between 8/10 or 7/10, but in the end I decided to go with 7/10 because of the length being too short for the amount of game play it's lacking, the story being incomplete/unexplained, and all the other cons listed above.",CaKeS

Play through it before writing a review, please. And I mean all the way through the campaign.Third and final, a lot of people are complaining and whining about the Batmobile and the fact that this game out too early. I find this funny because these are the same people who whined and complained about the Batmobile not being in the other games and the fact that Arkham Knight was pushed back not once, not twice, but FOUR times. Rocksteady read has done everything they can to make this work and you guys just come here and complain about it? If I was Rocksteady, I would honestly just stop making games all together for you people.Now, this is a message to everyone. If you're thinking about not buying the game because of some lousy reviews, please get the game. Seriously, don't let someone else's opinion decide whether you are going to buy a game or not. If you WANT to play it, then get it! It doesn't matter what others are saying, because who cares! When it comes to gaming, the only thing that matters is YOUR opinion!Anywho, sorry for all the ranting, but people just need to be told. This game is great, it is everything I was hoping for in the Batman finale, and it has blown me away on every scale. I am terrible sorry for those who did not enjoy it, but maybe those are the same people who enjoy CoD. Who knows? But wow, Arkham Knight took my breath away. It is predictable, yes, but does that ruin the game!? Heck no! It actually helps if you try not to think about it. Just play the game and enjoy it! But yes, the gameplay is flawless, graphics are stunning, story is on point, and the sound is great. Even the characters are wonderful. Come on: it's the same batman game we've been with since Arkham Asylum. Only this time, it's a lot bigger than Asylum and a lot more addicting then City. This game is beyond amazing. It never disappoints me tbh. And to all the Batmobile haters: I love driving it around. I don't care if it's forced on me, I'm going to drive it for fun because it's just THAT cool. I love it. Maybe add the Batwing next?

Jak and Daxter are back in their brand new adventure and this time its bigger and better than ever. The story picks off right after you completed the first game where, Jak and his friends, Kiera and Samos are testing out the Rift Rider and Precurspr Rift gate that you opened after collecting all of the Precursor Orbs in the last game. As you go through you get transported to a place called Haven City which is under command by Baron Praxis. Jak his captured and 2 years have passed since. Daxter manages to find Jak and help him escape, only to find out that Jak had gone through experiments by Dark Eco which can make him transform into a dark beast. Not only that but his personality has changed him into a teenage Jak. The gameplay is a lot different than the first game. You start off in the city and are given tasks to do by people. Once you've completed the first task, you move onto the next one and the next one, so it is like a step up ladder really. There are some challenges too which earn you Precursor Orbs if you pass them. You can ride new vehicles which you can steal from others, some are faster than others so you can get to places quicker because there is a lot of going back and forth in this game. Don't steal any of the krimzon guards vehicles or run into them otherwise the city will go on alert and they will start chasing after you and try and shoot you, try to outrun them if you can but its a real pain and wastes time. In fact its a sort of a GTA spin off this game. There are more tasks to accomplish and tougher ones too. You have new moves as well, spinning and punching is still there but this time you can carry a Rifle. The Rifle has 4 different types of shots and you have to collect these as you progress. And if that wasn't enough, when collect a number of Dark Eco you can transform into a dark beast  which makes you unvulnerable for a short period of time and you can go through and smash your way through hundreds of enemies to make your job a much easier. If you collect metal heads you can trade them in to the oracle and he will give you new abilities for your beast form. You can ride on a hoverboard which can float on water and there is a skate arena where you can pull of a few tricks (a bit like playing those Tony Hawk, SSX and Matt Hoffman games). There are hover races too which are loads of fun, there are more bosses this time and for the first time Daxter is a playable character too. This game has virtually everything to make this game stand out and I loved absolutely every bit of it. Bigger gameplay, more challenges and better moves. The graphics are done beautifully and some of the level designs (one of my faviroutes is the one where your inside a temple) are very impressive. The music is perfect and the voice acting is great, especially Daxter's who is as funny as ever. There aren't many sequels out there that are as good as the first but this one is way more superior to the first, so if you thought Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy was a great game wait till you get a taste of Jak 2",Neo010390

The battle system has even more depth with the addition of the audience and stylish commands.The gameplay itself is pretty much as perfect as the gameplay of the original. Although the game is structured similarly to the first paper mario game, as both use the storybook-like chapter system, each chapter is original. Chapter three and six especially change up the gameplay formula in an amazingly original way. The puzzles are better in this game than in the first, the bosses just as epic, and the characters and party members are just as characterized as in the first game bringing a sense of connection to the game. The main new gameplay element this game introduces is mario's ability to transform into various paper structures, allowing him to solve new and original puzzles. This game not set in the mushroom kingdom, but rather in an oceanside town called rougeport. This, along with the original chapter design keeps the game fresh. The game's story also improves upon the first paper mario. Bowser is no longer the villain, and you watch as he comedically tries to be one. This is all you need to know about the story, as the rest is revealed in the game. The end of chapter peach gameplay is back, but is accompanied by bowser gameplay too. The peach gameplay is once again the worst part of the game, but the bowser gameplay is very fun as you get to play several of the original super mario bros. levels as him. The graphics are very good and the soundtrack is very good as well, but is not quite as good as the original paper mario soundtrack. All in all, paper mario 2 is one of, if not, my favorite games of all time. The depth of the gameplay, wonderful characterization and level design from paper mario 1 is back, this time with improvements. The game also improves upon its storyline, poking fun at the traditional mario storyline of bowser always being the villain. If you can, get a copy of this game to play on your wii or gamecube, or get a copy of it for the wii u when it gets released. This may be the most polished mario rpg out there.",jamba24

We've considered Lego Dimensions. Based on my experience with Skylanders Swap Force, I felt that it beat Disney Infinity 2.0 hands down. Disney Infinity's missions were boring while Skylanders Swap Force was really fun. So we sold off all Disney Infinity and stuck with Skylanders. We avoided Skylanders Trap Team after all the poor reviews, but decided to jump into Skylanders Superchargers. Even with Superchargers, I still think it's better than Disney Infinity 3.0 and Lego Dimensions, due to the fun factor. So why just 7 stars?Simple, Skylanders Superchargers' driving / flying / sailing controls SUCK. The racing mode controls is OK and works as planned. However, in the battle driving mode, it is downright confusing and is the WORST controls I've ever seen in ANY driving game. Seriously, the designer who designed the driving / flying / sailing controls should have been promptly fired. This is the problem: your left and right facing navigation works one way when your vehicle is facing one half of the directions, but the navigation SWAPS automatically (so turning left becomes turning right, and turning right becomes turning left!) when facing the other half of the directions! What kind of a STUPID navigation scheme is that? Honestly, this ONE aspect alone, I've taken out 3 stars, because a good portion of the game is about navigating with vehicles!OK now that the single worst aspect of Skylanders Superchargers is out of the way, I'll cover all the good stuff.I believe Skylanders is still the most FUN toys to life game that’s suitable for a wide age range, so if you’re a parent and want to play with your kids, the level is just right for the kids, but yet fun enough for the adults. The characters are endearing and even “evil” Kaos is such an adorable villain! The characters are all appealing and each Skylander have their own personality. Their respective powers are different enough to warrant purchasing – though you probably don’t want to get ALL characters as some power variations do seem to be similar. And of course, the bonus is, all your old Skylanders characters will work with this game, so a PLUS for compatibility and well done to Activision for not leaving old characters obsolete.Gameplay-wise, the on-foot platforming elements are fun and pretty straightforward, with some crazy-looking villains. You move from chapter to chapter, expunging villains, collect coins and gear bits to upgrade your character’s powers and/or your vehicles. The level variations are good – one moment you’re on 3D platforming, another moment you’re on 2D side scrolling platforming, yet another moment, you’re in your vehicle racing / fighting away. As I said before, the racing elements with vehicles are fine, and is reminiscent of Mario Kart 8 (although not anywhere near as polished). Just get the “arena vehicle battles” out of the way quickly due to the frustrating controls. There’s enough variety in all the levels to encourage you to play through the whole game. I never felt bored in almost all the levels – except one or two optional flying ones where you have to destroy like 50 objects which seem to drag on forever. Of course, if you feel everything is too easy, you can crank up the difficulty to the max, but personally, I don’t play Skylanders for its difficulty.The storyline is good fun, again, doesn’t take itself seriously, and so makes you feel more relaxed during gameplay. It’s the usual “muahahaha” evil dudes trying to take control of Skylands and the Skylanders are there to turn their “muahahaha” to a “boo hoo”. It’s really cute really, and subject materials are all suited for families of all ages.As an adult, Skylanders Superchargers provides me with a good break from more serious and intense games such as Xenoblade Chronicles, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Sniper Elite 3! Despite the pathetic navigation with vehicles, I’d still recommend Skylanders over Disney Infinity and Lego Dimensions if you desire a relatively relaxed game time with your family, or you want a break from more intense PC games!

Point and click never seemed so active.Finally the story is very predictable, with very few dialogs and it's probably the worst part of the game, it will take something around 15 hours to finish game, far from the lying cover that guarantees 40 hours (a shame, specially that 15 hours is very honest for the genre).So in conclusion Zack and Wiki is a very good game if you want to put your brain to the test, the only better option I see is the Portal games (for the incredibly funny dialogs) and they're not available on Wii, so if you want a puzzle game and own this console go for it, just don't believe the cover, it's a big lie.",BaronMonaco

I live in Toronto, Canada where baseball is not popular, but I am still finding ranked games with no problem and virtually no lag. They really did a good job with the netcode for this game this time around. I also like the fact that I can make my ranked games suited to how I like to play now (which makes this an auto 10 for me) I like to play guess pitch 1/4 with all realistic settings on (ejects, injuries, variable ump) and the hot zone to preview (which only shows the hot zone first for the first pitch of every batter) Its the best. Another cool thing (mplayer is my main focus since I dont have many people that like the show) is that the matchmaking is based on who you pick for starting pitcher as well. you dont see who the other team picks until the game starts. the system matches your pitchers as well as teams!

By allowing devious flanking tactics, or encouraging heroic frontal assaults, STW was the first game to depict the frantic action of real time strategy with mainstream success.Which, when you consider that the game was originally intended as aShogun Total War is one of those games that allows you dream of how to gloriously command thousands (or, at least, dozens) of screaming samurai. By allowing devious flanking tactics, or encouraging heroic frontal assaults, STW was the first game to depict the frantic action of real time strategy with mainstream success.Which, when you consider that the game was originally intended as a 2D strategy game, makes this game a definitive milestone of the RTS genre.    The strength of game is its simplified unit interaction: like paper (spears), scissors (cavalry) and stone (archers) ever unit beats and counters an other unit. Unlike the expansive RTS units of SupComm or SCII, mastery of unit types should be expected in hours rather than weeks. There's no seeking for the 'overbalanced' unit combination or the perfect build-order in this game; only blood and thunder battlefield fighting.Ten years after first release, the gameplay still holds up surprisingly well. The kill rate of units is low (perhaps too low!) but this places a greater emphasis on the paper-scissor-stone principles by which the game runs. Add into this the significant effect of hills (archers will beat infantry with a height advantage in melee) and flanking (even now tying an enemy head-on with infantry and flanking with cavalry is the RTS staple tactic) and you have warfare that is satisfyingly expansive. By expansive I mean there is a real feeling that a smaller army can defeat much larger numbers with superior tactics. Such victories exploit the game's excellent morale model. You don't need to kill every soldier to win a battle. Even now I can remember battles a decade imprinted on my memory - the enemy ushered through a valley to attack my weakened archers; the hidden charge from woods; and the routing of one flank that rolls down the rest of the enemy until a fresh force flees from my emergent (and no doubt grinning) general.   The campaign mode itself was pleasingly simplified. I always played as Shimazu (the green ones) not least because they were tucked away in the corner. As always in such strategy games, no-one has yet devised a way to counteract strategic AI. In the end game, I always faced off the Hojo clan who had horded dozens of armies into a few spaces. While something that I accepted at the time, these days such a gameplay facet would (rightly) demand a patch, or simply recognise that the campaign is won when 50% of map is yours.The expansion pack (part of this game) goes some way to addressing these problems but it still lets slip with the overpowered brutality of the mongol heavy cavalry. Having spent 100s of battles watching body counters drop a man at a time, the shock at seeing multiple people die at once is enough to make the mongol expansion feel like the challenge of countering a truly warmonging race with what are essentially a civilised people. So should you own and play this game because it defined a genre? The graphics are, admittedly, pixilated with a 680 resolution. The campaign can drag on. Heavy cavalry aren't my first choice when I have infinite money. And the bridge battles are immensely arduous tests of attrition.But the immersion is still there. The sound is evocative of the Sengoku period and the battlefield principles are still refreshingly straightforward and effective. If you win a battlefield, you really feel a sense of control. Even more so than a ctrl + A then right click on their general. I've owned three copies of this game - you should grace your collection with one.",thequillguy

The faults in question were never game breaking or frustrating but rather just tiny little nitpicks here and there that just stopped it from being a near perfect masterpiece. This remastering, however, has fixed any issue the original had and turns Odin Sphere into a game that can sit along side the greatest games ever made.The combat is as fluid and solid as action based combat can get with minor improvements taking cues from Vanillaware's later title 'Muramasa: The Demon Blade' and the more recent Indie game 'Guacamelee' from Drinkbox Studio. The crafting and upgrading systems have been tweaked to be more modern and coherent. The ground breaking graphics and animation have had a crisp make-over and the stunning music and well acted voice work has been cleaned up.This is exactly what a remaster should be; take a classic game and modernize it and make it more accessible without compromising it's original integrity.What else can I say? If you liked the original; this is a better version (and for purists, there is 'classic mode' where the original game play is in tact). For fans of more recent Vanillaware titles like Muramasa: Rebirth and Dragon's Crown; Odin Sphere, in my opinion, is the definitive Vanillaware title.

With the Sega Saturn having the honor of having the best home console port, the 3DS has now the best version on the handheld.So, what makes this port so special? Here are a few points, ranking from graphics to sound, and not to forget: Playabillity.- Framerate has been improved upon. The arcade game ran 30 frames per second, the 3DS version 60, making for a extremely smooth oldschool arcade racer.- 2 new songs that where played by the hardware of the game. So the sounds are from the 80's hardware, but the compositions are composed also with that feel of the 80's in mind. They fit the game very well.- Unlockable extras. They are: 4 tuning parts. With one that improves steering, speed, less speed penalty when you collide with traffic and road furniture, higher top speed, and no speed loss when driving off the road. Also a Arcade mode is unlockable, where the game runs 30 frames per second, with it's own highscore table.- 3D effect looks cool, especially in tunnels and between those high rock wall this gives the speedy feel of the game a positive boost.- All buttons can be re assigned. I prefer A to be Acceleration, B for Brake, and R for gear swap. You can also go for a different way of gear use: Hold down the button for low gear, and release for high gear. This is most usefull for the gamers who knows how to do that gear shift trick to keep speed if you get off the road without using that unlockable option. Also you can stear the car with the thumb stick or the D pad, witch you don't need to select, both of them work stright away.- Lots of dificulty settings. Just like with the Sega Saturn version, you can give yourself more or less time, and choose to have a lot of traffic, or even a empty road! So for every play level, there's a skill level, everyone can at least finish the race, no matter how good or bad you where in the past.So all those positive points, and i did not even came to the best part. I think they did a brilliant job on the controlls. With the D pad i am a little more comfortable than the thumbs stick because before this release, i played Out Run a lot on the GameBoy Advance on Sega Arcade Gallery. So i was used to the sensetivity from a D pad, but in this new version, the D pad even feels more smooth than on that older version.There is only one thing that i feel is a shame, and that is that because this is not a big release, they did not go for the Ferrari licence, so the car is a red fictional car. At first, i thought this would remove that oldschool feel i have with the game, but play for a few minutes, and you don't even notice this anymore, mostly because they still did a great job of animating the movement, crash sequence, and somehow it still looks a bit like a Ferrari car, be it without the iconic stripes on the door/side pannel.So there you have it, and all this for just a small fee.

The graphics are its second problem, the are fuzzy and look overall bad, but the art design was very good and the graphics had a lot of potential. Sin and punishment also is a very hard, but it wants to be, so you will die possibly 1000+ times a level before you beat it which for me was never annoying because the levels are so much fun. The game also has a addicting multi-player were a second person also shoots, but its not great but its ok. the online leader boards are also a lot of fun, you will spend hours trying to beat a high score which will most likely adds another 3 hours to the 6 hour single player. so overall sin and punishment is very close to perfect and everyone should buy it.",Reviewer

Out of the three stunning tables created by Zen my natural Starwars instincts drew me of course to the Empire Strikes back and as soon as the Lightsaber's pull back spring shot my first ball into the abyss of droids and wampa's I was hooked. For some reason the original voices of the characters lines have been re-done by voice actors, albeit  very professionally but to the fellow die hard it's noticeable. All In this is a very fast paced table with a lot  of interesting concepts not seen from any other table Zen has to offer.Next on my hit list was the Fett table, and as soon as the game loaded it was distinguishable by it's very long and narrow horse's head shape. Zen have gone for The Return Of The Jedi look and have the sound effects from the film to support the Fetts own table with a lot of emphasis on the Sarlacc pit. As previously mentioned the table is incredibly long which means that some parts look squashed and in certain areas it's hard to see whats happened to your valued ball, None the less it's still a fun table and when the Fett utilizes his grappling hook to save the ball from being lost it screams awesome. The third and final table was left till last due to the Clone Wars not being very high on my radar in recent years, so off the bat this table was not high on my priority list. The table opens up to a very wide and beautifully created area, with an escape pod being deployed upon pull back of your ball, A mini Anakin can be seen responding to where the ball is run and the sound effects are full of Star Wars charm, my one complaint would be the odd Yoda phrase that is spewed out every ten seconds which didn't really seem to make much sense and was not in line with the Yoda we all listened to in the Empire Strikes Back.   To sum up all three tables have a lot of what made us all fall for the franchise in the first place  Some tables will be liked better than others and this is why for 800 MS points and a bit of supple pinball finger flicking you should just go for it and wonder what's just happened to the last three hours of your life.",TheMadSaint

For about ten years Paradox Development have been a small team of nice guys working hard to give us good games and mostly failing. Their games have been for the most part tedious, pretentious and ugly, with cluttered mechanisms, and hideous micromanagement. Most of the Paradox efforts suffered from terrible tutorials and ridiculous learning curved that discouraged any vaguely casual gamers. But beyond inaccessibility, the games were finally not that good, because even when you figured out the mechanisms they were still too MECHANICAL: not even really worth learning in the end because they were all variations of a sausage machine. However something miraculous happened with Crusaders Kings 2, and echoes of the good things we saw in earlier games (Hearts of Iron 2) reappeared: Better looking graphics. Simpler, yet DEEPER gameplay.  The machine kept churning away but Paradox learned to save us from the worst of it, and the gameplay began to blossom. Europa Universalis IV seems to demonstrate that Paradox has really turned the corner. The game is beautiful.  Gameplay is fluid. The depth and complication is welcome, but it has been softened with a more thoughtful and gaming friendly structure! GREAT WORK PARADOX! Good things take time, and your grand ambitions are finally bearing fruit. I'm very excited about where this will lead with the Hearts of Iron series, because all the design wisdom that we can see in CK2 and EU4 is leading in the absolute correct direction. If you love strategy gaming please go and buy this game and support this developer! This is a FAR, FAR superior game to Civilizations 1-5 as well as anything put out by Creative Assembly. It's been a long wait but worth it. Can't wait to see what we get when the final few pieces of the game design puzzle fall into place. If they get the budget to build something with a more solid multiplayer experience we will see the PERFECT game.",Orctownorc

However despite it's critical success (culminating in 9 out of 10 reviews from the esteemed pages of EDGE and Pocket Gamer), as a package, I must admit to harbouring an unshakable tinge of disappointment that, as a game built from the ground up for last-gen hardware, Velocity was unfortunately lacking the polish that it's otherwise high-end tactility and gameplay so desperately deserved. This was particularly evident when playing on a Playstation Vita.Aside from the now ubiquitous inclusion of highscore leaderboards to climb and PSN trophies to hoard, all that was needed was that final layer of HD-spit and native OLED-polish that would truly elevate this high-grade shooter to the lofty heights of indie folklore. Well, at least as far as Playstation indies are concerned. And now with the utterly fabulous Velocity Ultra, British based outfit, FuturLab are finally able to bask in all the glory and plaudits that their wonderfully nuanced and deeply rewarding IP so richly deserved from the very beginning.Having had a love affair with 8 and 16-bit pixel art for as long as I can remember, I must admit to initial pangs of disappointment to find the absence of the original games beautifully 'old skool' visual flavour, but I have always trusted this developers judgement, and pretty much consider their shift in presentational style to be a necessary evil of sorts.Regardless of what type of game floats your particular boat, Velocity Ultra is a truly exceptional game, much less one confined to the genre-specific reaches of shoot'em-up fame. As such, it represents the very embodiment of Sony's hugely appreciated pursuit of bringing some of the very finest offerings from the indie community to handheld and console audiences, both this gen and next.

This is essentially a Pay2Play environment. Formats include constructed, draft and sealed. The PvP additions (well, game) are champions and permanent effects (buffs) which remain in all zones. Shard (land) screw/flood is still an issue. Threshold (color) screw is a lessened by the mechanic, which is good. The Hex system removes the occasional skill involved in tapping lands, as well as allowing for better recovery due to not requiring each specific colored cost to be paid. In short, you could cast 4 Lightning Bolts with 1 Mountain 3 lands. The price model is also a benefit as limited PvP costs about half as much as Magic.PvE is the 'free to play' content. PvE has released its second update, but first installment of the Hex world. It is a limited taste, but shows potential. There is a lvl 9 cap - up to lvl 30 currently planned - and not all classes and races are available. There are talents for each race and class to add to the RPG feel of the game. Opponents abilities are interesting, making for some interesting (and frustrating puzzles). There are PvE only cards in addition to the PvP card sets. Most cards also have equipment to increase their power level. In PvE, a player can 'grind' gold, PvE packs, cards, equipment to trade for PvP currency to participate in that side of the experience (packs and platinum).The Bad - DEVELOPMENT - The world of Hex moves at a glacially slow pace. Original plans were 4 PvP sets per year. This has been reduced to 3 sets already. Current PvP rotation is >7 months on average through 3 sets. The first PvE world content was finally release 20 months after the Beta started and over a year after the Arena (first PvE experience). These cycles need to drastically improve before Hex can be considered a serious contender in the online TCG market.Bugs are also an issue, which is expected. However, the quality control on patches appears to be low as old bugs tend to reappear or previously working cards get 'broken' The code for some things is poorly written as demonstrated when champions for Set 2 could not be removed from the Champion pool for Throwback drafts involving only Set 1. These are mostly growing pains. Typically customer support is fair in resolving any issues.Final Thoughts: Hex has potential to be very successful. If you enjoy Magic the Gathering, you should give Hex a glance. As with any game, its success will depend on the frequency and quality of expansions. This is a growing sector of online gaming with new competitors frequently appearing. Hex has the vision to succeed well into the future. However, vision without execution makes for lost promise.",RealThoughts

On the other, I don't feel like I've gotten the value of a new game that cost $60  tax and feels like NBA 2k13+ rather than NBA 2k14.I specifically play the 2k series for the My Player/Career experience. I am not a fan of Lebron, and I will not be playing this year's new Lebron-centric mode. I do not consider the unique modes to be the best or most compelling aspects of the 2k series. I played through the Jordan challenges in 2k11, but put far more time into My Player than it took for me to complete Jordan's games. This review focuses on the aspect I play.We'll start with the positives first. Some of the updates to the in-game mechanics are good. Player movement seems more fluid and smoother. I've found contact is called for a foul more realistically, i.e. if I go for a bad block attempt and land on top of my assigned man, I'm going to get called for it rather than sliding in next to him. It also seems like passes thrown are not as easily picked off by the AI (as opposed to previous years where any opponent within 10 feet had a good chance of getting the steal or deflection). Another good change is the quick play ability by holding left-bumper. I've never been much of a play caller, but this change makes it quick and easy.The added diversity of special attributes available is also a welcome addition. More have been added, and there's even more of a strategic balance now between offensive, defensive and general abilities. Want to become the ultimate defensive stopper? You can load up on abilities that negate offensive abilities, increase your abilities to strip the ball during dribble moves, shots, and passes, and make you more difficult to get caught on a screen. The downside is you won't have much, if any, room for offensive abilities.To shift into things I view as negatives, I'll start with something I'm ambivalent about: the new control scheme using the right-stick and other buttons. On the one hand, it's pretty easy to reliably do specific moves, like behind the backs, spins, etc. On the flipside, doing a hopstep, which in 2k13 was executed by pressing the B button, is now done either by double-tapping X, or in the context of a layup by holding right trigger and holding the right stick to the left or right. The main issue is that double-tapping X is not reliable at all. More often than not, My Player simply pulls up and pump-fakes. I much prefer using the B button. If I had to choose, I would still opt for the 2k13 control scheme, and it's getting a little tiring relearning the controls every year.Now for the negatives.The game development comes off as being somewhat lazy. The graphics don't appear to be upgraded at all. I played 2k13 and then 2k14 in front of someone else who plays 2k, and neither of us could tell the difference. Many of the audio files and commentary are carried over from the previous year. The post-game press conference questions and answers for My Player are literally identical from the previous year; same with the graphics (except for maybe the sponsor logo in the background). After listening to the 2k13 commentary for at least a couple hundred hours, it would have been nice to have totally fresh audio for the new game.General player AI continues to be passable at best. If anything, they now step out of bounds more than before. They are also prone to shooting from behind the backboard when on the baseline, especially when close to the basket. And if I cut off the passing lane to my man, sometimes the AI will dribble the shotclock down to 0 with their center out at the 3pt line, and proceed to have said center hoist a 3 pointer he has no chance of making. These are all carryover issues from past games, but stepping out of bounds seems to have worsened. And just like in 2k13, the AI refuses to cover me at the 3pt line even with a rating of 85 from that range. You can literally sit outside and rain all day.Mechanics that are not good:- Blocking is ridiculously unbalanced in this game. I have a rating of 35 block with a 6'7"" PG/SG and average 4 per game. I can come from behind like Lebron on fast breaks and destroy lay up attempts. I also routinely block centers and PFs. This also leads to a large amount of goal-tending.- Driving the lane isn't worth the risk since you lose the ball very easily. The defense doesn't have to actively try to steal the ball so much as run into you.- The coaching is broken. I start at SG (with PG as my actual position) for OKC, and then at the end of games Russell Westbrook rides the bench while I play PG opting to put in a player (Jeremy Lamb) rated 20 pts lower.All in all, NBA 2k14 is a very incremental upgrade over NBA 2k13 in the My Player/Career department. If you really want updated rosters and rookies, I'd recommend waiting until prices drop/picking up a used copy. Otherwise, pass.",PJTheFadangler

The special stages are absolutely horrendous. They're slightly reminiscent of Sonic 2, which is fine in itself, but it involves a 3D plane, which really doesn't work well on the Gameboy Advance. It's incredibly difficult to determine where to place yourself, and as a result, makes collecting Chaos Emeralds tedious and frustrating. Fortunately, they're not necessary to enjoy the bulk of the game.The graphics are truly some of the best GBA games have to offer. Most of the environments are vivid, and the character animations are incredibly detailed. Sonic Team did an amazing job of the spriting. Even idle animations capture my attention, giving the characters a huge amount of personality.The game features four playable characters; Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and most interestingly, Amy. All play in a unique way, offering different paths and speeds. Sometimes these differences will benefit you, and at other times, you'll wish you picked another character. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles play as they did on the original Genesis games, albeit with a few extra moves, such as Tails' (useless) tail swipe, and Knuckles' (useless) punches. This game introduces Amy as a playable character for the first time in a 2D Sonic game. Amy is most certainly the most enjoyable character to play as- She offers a whole new level of depth to the game, requiring you to master your timing, as she lacks the ability to curl up. Instead, she can use her hammer to attack, which is actually advantageous in many situations. For example, she can jump higher using a special move, and has a longer range than Sonic's insta-shield. She can even defeat certain bosses easier than the other three, as her range far exceeds the others. It is a common complaint that Amy is ""not fun"" and ""too hard"", but to that, I say, unironically: Get good. These characters introduce a large amount of replay value, as well as fun, new ways to play.The sound of this game is, as always, very memorable. Sonic games almost never get this wrong. However, whilst the tracks are memorable and the sound effects are great, it definitely suffers due to the limitations of the GBA sound card. This doesn't stop them from being catchy and appealing, though.Overall, Sonic Advance is a brilliant game, and most certainly the best out of the trilogy. It keeps speed to a good pace, but isn't too fast, and also has 4 unique ways of playing. It's not without flaws, but it's still an extremely solid experience. I definitely enjoy them more than the Genesis games, myself... but that's a matter of opinion.",AmyRoses

760,Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3,PlayStation2,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Persona 3 combines Life Simulation & Role-Playing Game (RPG) genres, making it a unique gaming experience. It falls under the JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Game) genre with games like ‘Final Fantasy’ or the ‘Tales of’ series, due to the Japanese anime style of the characters & Japanese setting. It was released by Atlus for PS2 in 2007 with a Mature (16+) rating. It is a long journey, spanning 70+ hours. Due to the way the game is paced, with one day leading directly into the next, it is easy to get trapped in very long play sessions. Some segments last over an hour without a place to save. If you die, you go back to the last save, so I recommend playing on easy on the first run, as you get 10 ‘Plume Of Dusk’ items which revive your whole party, restoring all HP/SP, these can’t be bought after they’re used, so use them sparingly!The game is centred around the trials & tribulations of Japanese high school life, where you spend the day developing ‘Social Links’ with classmates & others you meet in the town of Tatsumi Port Island. By night you & your team fight monsters (‘Shadows’) to save the world.The main mechanic is the ability to evoke a ‘Persona’. Personas are a ‘manifestation of one’s psyche’ (a part of your personality manifested into real form). There are 170 personas that the protagonist can obtain & make use of, due to his ‘Wild Card’ nature. Other persona users can only access 1 persona – methods of this include cards in ‘shuffle time’ at the end of battles & when using the ‘Velvet Room’ where you can fuse personas to make others. Personas can be levelled up by Social Links, relationships the protagonist makes through the course of the game. Each one has an ‘arcana’ (corresponding to tarot cards) & are levelled up the more you talk to people during life simulation periods. Social Links are like real relationships, you want to spend enough time with the person so the link doesn’t become reversed, preventing you from levelling up personas of that arcana until it is fixed. However, this can also happen if you spend too much time with that person, making it a complex balance. The game has a dark atmosphere, including the method that party members evoke their personas, putting the evoker (an instrument closely resembling a gun) to their head & pulling the trigger. One of the main aspects is the mysterious Dark Hour, said to fall between one day & the next. During this time normal humans are transmogrified into coffins, all electrics cease to work, besides those modified to, & all liquids turn blood red. Those transmogrified remain blissfully unaware of the hours’ presence, but S.E.E.S can experience this hour & use this time to defeat enemies (Shadows) in their nest, known as Tartarus, the main dungeon in the game. The Shadows came about with the Dark Hour & feed on the psyche of humans who have been lured out of their coffins.The protagonist is a 17 year old Japanese school boy who has the ability to use a persona, at the start you are asked to join a ‘school club’ called S.E.E.S (the Specialised Extra-curricular Execution Squad) a group of persona users you are living in the dorm with. S.E.E.S expands over the course of the game, eventually encompassing persona users of many types that are strong & weak to different abilities.Battles occur when you hit an enemy or an enemy hits you, taking you to a separate screen. During a battle you can use persona specific abilities: Bufu (ice), Garu (wind), Agi (fire), Zio (electricity), Light, Dark & Almighty. Abilities that characters can equip through various weapons & that personas can also have are strike, slash & pierce attacks – physical attacks demonstrated during the powerful ‘All-Out Attack’ you can perform once all enemies have been knocked down by having their weakness exposed. You can find these out by asking your out of field scouter to analyse the enemies.The games’ graphics aren’t as good as other PS2 titles of the time, Final Fantasy X (2001) graphics far excel those of Persona 3. In addition, colours appear quite washed out, mainly being dirty greens/reds during the dark hour. Black looks more green, seen on enemies crawling the dungeon floor, & white looks more grey as seen on character uniforms/floor tiles. However, animated cut-scenes & drawn elements look stunning. The graphics don’t really hold your understanding of the game back, as character emotions are expressed in drawn portraits above their speech & convenient over head emoticons (exclamation marks/sweat drops).Overall, Persona 3 is a great game, with an in depth story & developed & unique characters. I would definitely recommend it to JRPG fans & also dungeon–crawler fans who are looking for a new experience.",EW7783

And I'm going to leave it spoiler-less so people won't be inclined to skip it.I'm seeing a lot of hemming and hawing in this review thread about why ""professional"" reviewers were going nutso over this game. I think I can boil it down to two things: Nostalgia and Originality. These are great qualities in a game, but this game relies almost entirely on them.I'm also seeing a lot of talk on here about the gameplay being ""non-gameplay"". It's an adventure game  they don't traditionally rely greatly on twitch or other tired game types. And it clearly doesn't want to be a game like that. In fact, the game does a pretty good job at being simply an adventure game, in that it unfolds in front of you and gives you plenty to interact with.Where that falls short is that there are no interesting puzzles in the game at all. No head scratchers, nothing you even have to figure out on your own. It's not Myst, not even close. It had plenty of opportunity to be that kind of game, but I think the developers were more interested in telling their story.Of course, I'd even be fine with that (a la Heavy Rain), but it fails miserably at being an interesting story. It's true that it's not a story you often see depicted in video games, but it's been done to  in Hollywood and literature for decades. The climax itself is so trite and overdone it's almost laughable. The game tries to look at you with this wry smile like, ""Aren't we bold and interesting? Look how progressive we are!"" to which I just shake my head in confusion.And the length? When I finished the game, Steam smirkingly showed that I had done so in 99 minutes. By my math, that's about $0.20/min. Parking in San Francisco is cheaper than that, and at least I'd see more interesting things wandering around the city for an hour and a half than I did wandering around this game.I promise you're not missing anything here. Wait for a Steam sale if you must, but I promise your money is better spent on just about anything else.",dclowd9901

Nothing I've played on the Xbox 360 or PS3 or ANYTHING made today has had the same effect on me that this has. Before I played this game I thought things like Dead Space and/or Resident Evil games were freaky, then I figured it was about time I played Silent Hill games. I started with Homecoming, which wasn't really all that great, and then I figured I should start from the beginning and work my way forward - so I found it online, bought it, and found myself successfully freaked out. The visuals alone are groundbreaking. It's like a well-shot movie and a nightmare at the same time, and, though the mysteries are explained in later games, I was never completely sure what the hell was going on in the town in the first place prior to my playing of other sequels. The game resembles a psychological, nightmarish experience as perfectly as a game can - and the crappy graphics of the late 90s helps with this effect. Also, though many may complain about the difficult controls, I think they helped add to the experience and desperation of certain situations. Even now the effects of this groundbreaking game can leave you on the edge of your seat, and though it isn't an easy game to find (unless, of course, you're able to buy it on PSN, which I haven't checked to see if it's available), you should definitely consider it.",doodlerman

I'm a Baseball fan, and I haven't been this addicted to a game in a LONG LONG time. This game is just that good. It's not meant to replace MLB: The Show, rather it's meant to compliment it. This game is much more simulation based than The Show, and really shows you the GM side of Baseball. Great game for Billy Beane wannabes. Gotta say, it's super fun to finish 1st in your division and win the World Series in this game. Heck, it's even enjoyable waiting during loading screens! because during loading screens, the game tells you all sorts of interesting things about the great game of Baseball. For example, I learned that Babe Ruth pitched a 14 inning complete game once in the WS. Also, the season Roger Maris hit 61 bombs, he wasn't walked even once! overall great stuff to learn for any baseball fan. If there is one thing wrong with this game, it's that you don't fully get the feeling that you're playing in the MLB. There is an optional add-on you can download from the add-on center in the game itself (another very good feature) that provides you with all the MLB logos, player faces, and managers. Still, many of the players are depicted with great inaccuracy, and generally the feel of the Majors is lost.",HorrHeyy

Had to get use to the pause and give commands to my party feature versus the turn based combat of D.O.S. but the atmosphere and story is far more gripping than the one in D.O.S. Spell management is a little tricky and rest is not possible to heal or to study your spell book without the campfire equipment found at shops and other merchants. Character creation is fairly diverse.Its great you can have a party of six adventurers instead of just the two you have in D.O.S and when a party member is not being used you can always find them back at the Black Hound Inn. I  have about 15 hours in so far and can't wait to get back to playing it. It can be challenging and you have to go back and keep trying different tactics to defeat different enemies but its not enough to make you rage quit like say Dark Souls caused many, not myself, to do. Party management and character action commands have been made very easy with the XBOX One controls.I will be finishing this and then going back to finish D.O.S",ancientgamer68
794,Resistance: Fall of Man,PlayStation3,8," The game is one of the best FPS games I've played (not many as I'm not a super fan of the genre), with an engaging story telling, mixing animation and great artwork. Voice acting is also great, specially Rachel Parker, a Captain he helps rescuing from the Chimera. Rachel follows Nathan over the radio during the hole game, giving him directions and tips of what to do. Here are my The game is one of the best FPS games I've played (not many as I'm not a super fan of the genre), with an engaging story telling, mixing animation and great artwork. Voice acting is also great, specially Rachel Parker, a Captain he helps rescuing from the Chimera. Rachel follows Nathan over the radio during the hole game, giving him directions and tips of what to do. Here are my scores: Graphics:8.0 The game looks gorgeous, I'd say it really shows the PS2 and the XBox are in an old generation of consoles, but it turns out that it is also far from using the full power of the PS3. The expressions on Nathan Hale's face are not really involving, for a guy who is going through some really had times, he lacks some personality in his expressions. The colors in the game are pale, giving it a gloomy feel that you would expect in a game picturing a war in England during the 50's, it really makes you feel like you are in seeing images from the past, just brilliant. The models for the weapons, the chimera, the vehicles, the buildings and the other environmental stuff are very well rendered and detailed, there is a part of the game where it is snowing, if you spin around, you will really get a very nice sense of relative movement. One thing that was really bad is that while playing, your character is not a fully rendered body, but just a gun and and a hand, you might be asking, how did I noticed that if the game is in first person, well try to find a corner than look all the way down, you will understand. Story: 9.0 This is the best part, because during the entire game they keep showing you bits and peaces of a whole, that you will still be unaware in the end of the game. This gives them a lot of ground to work on more titles that unfold the real background behind the chimera. Even though the animations of Hale look too plain and without feeling, it's Rachel who tells the story, with her very truthful British accent and emotion enough for you to forget about the rest. The story makes you want go through the game just to see how it will turn out and leaves you wanting to know the answers to a lot of questions. As this is a franchise, this is actually a good thing. Sound: 7.5 The battle field does sound like it should and the quiet areas to, what it does bad is that if you step slowly on a surface it will make the same noise as if you were jumping. While this is great to give you the scares if you are trying sneak in quiet scenarios, it detracts a lot from the realism you expect in the sound of today games. The surround sound works well, but it's just a good sounding game, not great, not superb, not perfect. Gameplay: 8.5 Fun, rewarding and fast paced. I am not super into FPS games, I'm more of a sneaking kind of guy, but in Resistance, I have to admit that I really enjoyed going berserk at the times the game forced me to. If you, on the other hand, love to go crazy shooting all that moves, you will love this game, specially because friendly fire is ON. The AI is great at times, the enemies will take cover when under fire and will attack you with grenades while you are under cover, but there are many times when you are able to shoot a chimera slowly to death without seeing any sort of reaction. Some chimera have different behavior, being more aggressive and visceral, trying to attack you no matter what, these are the best times to use your good and old shotgun. When playing coop, the game does some funny (weird) stuff, as it is check point triggered, when you hit a check point area, the game will force your buddy there by teleporting him there and as the campaign is the same as the single player, only in vertical split screen mode, the game totally ignores the other character, story wise, as if he never existed. Generally, if you are covered, you don't have to worry about enemies shooting at you, unless they guys are shooting with a weapon called Auger, which can go through anything. This really adds to the game play, forcing you take action instead of hiding when you have these kinds of enemies around. Sniping is just great, with special headshot animations and a special effect that I will not spoil here. There is also different animations when you kill them by shooting their legs, the effect is really good. One other problem I noticed, is that you cannot hold the grenade for a while to maximize the damage, but at the same time it was cool to see chimeras jumping away in order to scape my grenades. I wish Hale could do that too. There are lots of unlockables in the game which became available (you get a message on scree) when you accomplish certain things, too bad trophies are yet to come. Interactivity: 7.0 Yeah, I can play PS2 games where I go through vegetation or other things without it moving, but on the PS3... sorry guys, I want you to animate the environment, it could be a simple animation like the ones we had in Metal Gear Solid 3, but yes, I want the environment to interact with me, when I throw an RPG in a wall, it is ok with me if it doesn't collapse, but I need it to show some damage. I really hope to see a game where you can shoot a tree to make it fall over a house giving you an alternative way to access another area of the map without making the game a sandbox. Multiplayer: 7.5 The offline campaign is super fun to play with a friend, even though, as I already said, the game pretends Nathan's friend is not there, but the choice of making it Vertical splitscreen wasn't really for my taste, I know this is a compromise, either horizontal or vertical, you will end up loosing area, but I personally rather see my enemies than a little bit more of the sky. On the online part, it is a lot like Quake, you got a good variety of weapons, energy packs, ammo... and many guys to shoot but I have to tell you, I was destroyed in the matches I've participated, so it wasn't really fun for me.",LuizO.

What I mean is that I'm playing Warhammer, but it doesn't necessarily feel like Total War. The game has been dumbed downI'll be honest, I didn't come into Total War: Warhammer with much faith in CA. After the release of Total War: Attila, I was worried that the franchise might not rebound, but with Warhammer it seems to be on the right path, but not necessarily the right direction. What I mean is that I'm playing Warhammer, but it doesn't necessarily feel like Total War. The game has been dumbed down dramatically, in particular with managing provinces and raising armies. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it lacks the Total War feel. Of course you have to expect some give and take in that regard, but it's also the reason why I only gave it a 7 and not an 8-10.Yes the game has great graphics, yes it runs much smoother than Attila, however it didn't really expand on the elements that made so many of us love Total War in the first place. In fact it felt like they tried to do the same things they did with Attila, for instance, there are only 4 starting races, with one bonus race if you pre-ordered. That's about the same amount of factions in the first game, as far as unique unit types. So what you can expect is numerous new factions being added, but only at a cost. The trick to appeasement is to offer new stuff, but not significant amounts of new stuff, to make us believe that they're not trying to nickle and dime us on additions to the game.Alright, so the game play is good, simplistic, but good. The addition of a fantasy element really does make you think. Is it a bad game? By no means. Is it everything I'd hoped for? By no means. Would I still buy it knowing what I do now? Most likely, but I'd still be griping about what I felt should've been changed or kept the same. Maybe I'm just one of those people that can't be satisfied. Anyways, I hope that helped.",NubNub

The additions (of which there are a few) utilize the source engine's physics and graphics in ways that remind you of Half-Life 2. These are not modders, they're developers - and have made a shining masterpiece which raises the bar on third-party game development in the source engine. It's faithful to the original, and yet creates this bizarre sense of deja vu with Half-Life 2 - making them feel like one contiguous game, no longer separated by 6 years or different engines. They have truly done the impossible. This is a must-play.",CrazyGoat

By far and large the quality of this disc far exceeds the other 3. I do admit I was a huge fan of this band in my earlier days, thus the purchase but it is actually the sheer quality of the production of this disc that is second to none. At first I thought i was bias to liking Metallica so much but I was amazed all my company was so fully entertained with this particular disc. I would have guessed the music would have been too harsh for them but no, of all the guitar heros we played this one seemed to satisfy everyone the most. The most fun was introducing an 8 yr old to Motorhead and the fastness of Metallica's song Battery. Somehow some bands just capture the essense of entertainment whether it is listening or playing. The other discs, well to be honest after playing Metallica I thought they were done just ok at best. They just didn't have the right feel as i felt their songs generally had no very good production values. They sounded tinny. I was most surprized by the Beatles because the reviews went on and on how good the production values were. I just didn't see it. But maybe that's because Guitar Hero Metallica's were so far and above all the others.

Thankfully it delivers just like the first game did and whilst it’s pretty similar to the first game it still gave me a lot of enjoyment. The first thing you will realise is that the game has a huge amount of content and without a doubt you get value for your money, which is great. Some of the content in the game does require some grinding though and it can become tedious, but you can certainly get past this. The level design helps you get past the grinding brilliantly, and I was very impressed with the variety each level had. Without a doubt the most important thing in a game like this is the shooting mechanics, and thankfully they’ve done extremely well here. The shooting mechanics feel tight and responsive throughout and this is very important because the later challenges will frustrate you a great deal because the difficulty will definitely test you, but thankfully you can rely on the mechanics to help you get through it. Another thing I was impressed with was the upgrading mechanics that have been implemented in the game. These upgrading mechanics really do give you a reason to continue to play, and the best thing is that when you upgrade you can actually feel the benefits of it. The presentation side of the game may be simple but it’s also very effective at the same time. There isn’t much that’s memorable when it comes to the sound design, but I must admit that I thought the visuals definitely had a certain charm about them. At the end of the day Sky Force Reloaded has continued where Sky Force Anniversary left off, and that means if you enjoyed Anniversary then you will once again have a great time with the new game in the series. My only real gripe with the game is that I would have liked them to have mixed the formula up a bit in this version, but I suppose if it’s not broke then there’s no need to fix it. Sky Force Reloaded without a doubt gets a recommendation from me and hopefully there will be more game’s in the series.",Xbox_Alive

It's the first time in a Borderlands game where I don't feel like I am thrown into a sandbox area and its refreshing.It actually feels like a linear adventure with little side roads along the way which is refreshing to the usual Borderlands game dynamic of grab quest, run either north, east, south, west to complete, and then backtrack to complete quest.It is easily the best DLC to Borderlands 2. I would rank them as:1) Dragon Keep- Fantastic2) Pirate Captain Scarlett DLC   Good to Great3) Torgue Campaign- Average to Good (mainly because of Mr. Torgue)4) Hammerlock- Forgettable other than the graphic design",EddieHokie

It's too bad that the original came out for Sega CD because by the time it was reworked for PSX, LUNAR was graphically dated and didn't get the praise that it highly deserved as one of the best RPG series of all time.Why is that? Well, it's the writing and the likeable characters that do it for me. Working Designs put great care into their translations, and they were leagues better than the competition at that time, with none of that awkward stuff common in 1990's JRPG's. That, combined with a far bigger adventure than the first LUNAR, make it an incredible journey and game. The music of the series is also incredible, and I still have it on my computer. Check out Star Dragon Theme and compare it to the quality of other games of the 16/32-bit era.If you can still play through games like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6, or any other of those classic JRPG's, I highly recommend the Sega CD or PSX version of LUNAR Eternal Blue.",mavjs

This has been the case for previous Gears games too, but this is 2016 and the series is in need of some refreshing ideas not just a retread of the same tired formula.Multiplayer is fine but is hurting already on PC due to a very low playerbase, cross-play does not work in versus multiplayer so as soon as the PC playerbase dies out this game will be worthless unless you're really into the 5 hour campaign.The game has insanely overpriced microtransactions too. The items inside are completely random and are most likely going to be worthless since they know idiots will keep paying money in hope they get a rare item.

This way you can put it easier in order and even assign it a positional number.Now, I guess the idea is that you hear about new keywords in the clips, and then you search on with them so you get the complete interrogation. But that's not how it works.After bruting for 5 hours I noticed a major flaw there with which you can just cheat through the game really (I'll mention that one at the bottom again).The Story itselfStorytelling is good and it probably wouldn't work too well if you just watched it in chronological order. But even then it would still be a good story.The issue is, the storytelling doesn't work at all if you spoiler ahead by accident really because you find a clip which is set on the last day.So really, it doesn't work either way.Now, your best bet in my opinion is to not play the game at all. The gameplay is crap anyway, it's just a time waster at best. Just watch a longplay on Youtube instead.OR - there's a flaw in the game that let's you get the clips in chronological order easily. Just reset the whole thing, search for blank. That gives you the first 5 clips because that's the default keyword.Change that keywords to 1,2,3,4,5 - search for blank again.

I cannot begin to explain how weak and underwhelming the story and dialogue are. Gone are any sort of characterization or suttle narrative undertones.

Gone is the once articulate, conniving, Mengsk who has been reduced to a babbling old fool, the fiery Jim Raynor who is now simply there to be a damsel in distress. Kerrigan's actions and motivations are consistently questionable; there are a lot of failed attempts at evoking emotion, but frankly, you just don't care about her or Jim anymore.

The multi-player is polished and the visuals are smooth, if you don't care about the campaign at all (and just shelled out $40 for a few new units), then I'd give it a 7/10 or 8/10.

It is also riddled with plot holes and continuity issues. Seriously, modern authors suck ass. The aliens aren't even the same ones that were featured in the first game. WTF? The game also loses the vaunted sandbox nature of its predecessor. That incredible ability to approach the situation from any conceivable angle is now gone; you only have two options in this game. You can either use armor and go in with your guns blazing, or you can use stealth to sneak by everyone, possibly killing him or her silently along the way. Moreover, the environment is now completely static. Lampposts stay standing after enduring a round of swarmer missiles; buildings don't deform after taking a shot from a tank. The list goes on and on. This destructibility was present in the first game. Why isn't it here now? Don't even get me started on the graphics: they are horrid, especially considering how good the first Crysis looked. In this regard the game disappoints on all fronts: the lighting is excessive and fake, the motion blur is nauseating and overdone, bad textures are everywhere, the vegetation is lacking in geometric detail, object deformation effects are virtually absent, and the skin shading is sub-par. Why did they bother making Cry Engine 3? Screw the damn consoles. If they had rendered this game with the Cry Engine 2, it would have looked much better. Hell, Cry Engine 1 might have looked better.What happened to Crytek's design team? They abandoned the formula that made them great in the past and made a **** COD clone.

Here is a list:so list:capturing frigates on mission 3 fails to give you back the captured ships.because the physics (ballistic) system is not being used gearbox modified all the unit stats and balance around the RNG system, meaning ships like destroyers are hard countering frigates, ships move weirdly.I did warn people about this change, but everyone said it was not a big deal... now you are seeing the consequences.Multiple queues are limited to 2, this broke balance further in hw1.Support frigates needing to dock with ships means they cannot repair fast nor at long range nor actually support.support frigates cannot hyperspace while carrying strike craft.Formations are completely broken (they are not working at all) this also is because the game is using RNG instead of ballistic system.capturing carriers or alike will not allow you to build ships with them.because they are using triggers instead of game mechanics capturing resource collectors on missions where you have to destroy them, will consider them as alive and keep giving resources ad infinitum to carriers to magically keep popping fighters or frigates.capturing ships sometimes will make them pop out ships from the enemy team (carriers).the special ability keys mostly do NOT work with bandbox selection, this includes salvage frigates (and pretty much means its a pain to use them).because ships aren't taking onto account collision paths on the asteroids missions fighters will not evade asteroids and will get massively crushed.friendly ships keep attacking ships that are already being hold by enough salvage corvettes meaning they often destroy your prey.shift+click for queuing fast 5 on 5 ships does not work.there seems to be an arbitrarily low strike craft build limit active?The UI ships icons are night impossible to clearly identify what do you have selected.the mouse seems to be lagging (is it hardware accelerated?)salvage corvettes suddenly seem able to easily capture enemy corvettes (this is because it seems... evasion mechanics were disabled because they do not affect the RNG system) so they fly linearly and just get clamped easily.salvage corvettes are not showing their capture beam animation.the camera zooming out seems to be limited so much you cannot have a good view of the battles unless you go into tactical view which...tactical view Is broken.the game randomly crashes on missions 4/5missing select unused harvesters button.gearbox did it on purpose but why research needs to cost resources at all? it could have been left to work just like hw1, this seems to be an unnecessary change.",DudeMaister

One thing missing is Old time strategy gamers like me who fell in love with the MOO series knows how disappointing it has been waiting for something to even come close to the Microprose classics. Well Galactic Civilizations II comes prett darn close to filling the void. A nice technology tree, awesome AI, customizable ships, and a great 3D strategy engine helps you relive the glory. One thing missing is tactical control of starship battles as they are played out only in cinematic view. The technology tree is also a little bland as Laser I-IV are as creative as they can get. On the plus side it is a constant design challenge to use equip your ships with the proper defense and weapons. Ship design is also a great feature where your options as far as cosmetic are limitless. Your ships on the starmap actually look like the one you designed too. The 3D starmap is a direction these games need to go where you set at what level you see the model of your ship or a color coded icon from a GOD's eye perspective. Diplomacy is also more fullfilling as the AI is truly the best I have seen in these type of games, MOO included. As far bugs, I have encountered very few bugs, and none that detract from the game. There practically weekly updates so the you know the publisher is on top of their game.",BrianY.

The formula hasn't changed an awful lot since the first title, though many subtle improvements to game mechanics and general presentation have been made. Cut scenes and audio files are clearer than ever, with added improvements to the second titles 'memo' function (such as the ability to change ink colour) being of great aid during those more trickier of brain teasers. The pace of the game may be a little too slow for some, though it's not difficult to become captivated by Layton's gorgeous looking surroundings and intrigued by some of the more perplexing mysteries that pop up during the final half of the adventure. Voice acting, be it fitting, can seem incredibly cheesy and at some points fails to aid the experience as it irritates more than captivates.Hint Coins have almost tripled in numbers since the first title, with the new optional 'Super Hint' function allowing far more users to solve even the most complicated of math puzzles without feeling like you've cheated.If you enjoyed the first two Layton outings- I cannot recommended this third game enough, as it's certainly the best of the three. Puzzles remain fun and do not detract from the experience as much as they did with Curious Village, with most being optional if players wish to favour the narrative and push on with it instead.",bolt7

The days when you could actually speak to most people playing and issue warnings of a looming sniper or vocalise strategy's, when a game actually felt realistic almost like you were there. I remember sprawling in the thick undergrowth actually raising my head for real, in a vane attempt to look over the grass. The game throughout the franchise had a real community spirit and with so many configurable options and a ridiculous amount of amazingly atmospheric diverse maps you were never far away from the next great online battle . You were also part of a team and you treated the maps strategically as such and that atmosphere and team spirit is what's missing from the modern shooters. Have you noticed how all the new breed of so called strategy shooters, advertise the fact you should play as a team ? But how many games do you jump into where people actually do? GRecon was the kind of game that didnt need to try and coax you into such.Well I played Graw 2 again the other day after selling GRFS and you know what? it still hasn't lost that original charm, after all those years it still feels fresh compared to all the modern shooters, GRFS included. The community might be a lot smaller but you can generally always find a a decent game where people still talk and have a laugh with one another. After playing this again, I realised that GRFS would have been far more successful, just updating on the previous formula. Instead what we got was a game selling its soul and providing us with yet another COD clone, albeit a 3rd person view and a Gears of war cover system tagged on. What a shame!!",beggz

The frame rate is often jarring, and there are constant freezes and stutters. Anything beyond a few feet is fuzzy and out of focus. Several doors literally took a few minutes to even open - so much so that I Initially thought I wasn't supposed to be going through them. The game glitched at one point, causing me to spend a good 15mins trying to work out what I was supposed to do, before resorting to a walkthrough - something I despise - only to discover the only way to proceed was to reload the game. Added to this, it also crashed a little after this.Technical issues aside, the hacking into people's memories was initially fun...but Blooper Team purposely decided to put all these graphical glitches in, to the point that they become, to my mind, the absolute worst part of the game. With each and every hack, it becomes an absolute chore trying to work out where to go and just what the hell you're supposed to actually be doing. Especially when the screen is shaking and these glitches are obscuring vast chunks of the screen. Truly starts to feel overly protentious.The games is not completely without positives. Indeed, if not for the intriguing narrative, and setting, there's no way I would have made it through to the end. I adore Blade Runner, and there's a slight nod to that here, but nowhere near as much as I was hoping, though Rutger Hauer does a fine job. And all in all, the absolute slog to get to the end leaves me wishing I hadn't spent so much on the game. Indeed, the sole reason for feeling compelled to write a review is to warn others that, on Xbox One at least, this game feels thoroughly unfinished and, even at half the price, would be too much. Truly feel fairly appalled that a game can ship in this state, and Blooper Team have the cheek to ask for so much money. And I am absolutely mystified at the high scores it's been getting. At the very least, please check out a stream or two before investing in this thoroughly disappointing and underwhelming experience.",Lotan52

From the moment of installation which has a nice song till finish installation it gave the feeling of you are inside the story.

I had never bored playing this game and still playing till now (June 2012). Thank's to the fans and C&C community on this. There is no doubt that Red alert 3 and its expansions Uprising had a much better graphics. But Red Alert 2 & Yuri revenge definitely had a better story lines and missions. I wish they could be reproduced or remastered it in a better graphics. Command & Conquer 3 and 4 are not even close to compare. I played Command & Conquer 4 and stop at mission 3 or something. I have no interest to continue anymore. Command & Conquer 3 is a much better version than Command & Conquer 4. Red alert 3 is a much better version than any Command & Conquer series.

If thats not enough, they haven't even announced extra guitar's for the wii, so co-op and its extra songs (MAJOR OVERSIGHT on activision's part) are as good as untouchable, even if only one or two are decent. Beyond all this, its still guitar hero. And guitar hero is fun, even if activision has tried its hardest to screw it up. I suggest getting it on another system or waiting for rockband. P.S. While Guitar Hero is definately not an actual instrument, thats no reason to pointlessly flame its players. Most, if not all, understand that the actual instrument is much more impressive when played, no matter how arrogant some of them may be at times.

This lowering of skill set is actually a breath of relief in many ways, most notably because you will feel as though you can really master those turns rather quickly and you’ll know where and when you are going wrong fairly easily. DiRT Rally on the other hand took dedication. Dedication, a few smashed controllers and hours upon hours upon hours upon… you get the idea.Offering up two distinct handling modes from the off, Gamer and Simulation, you can play the game however you desire. Even when selecting the ‘easier’ Gamer mode, you’ll still be able to tinker with various car set ups and tweak to your hearts desire, finding the perfect balance for each and every circuit and vehicle.The main game career mode is essentially split into 4 main areas, traditional Rally mode, Land Rush, Rally Cross and Historic Rally.Rally mode is as you’d expect – tight timed stage events on tarmac and off-road terrain in varying weather.Land Rush – short dirt track races in buggies, trucks and cross karts over big bumps, multiple vehicles on track, much contact.Rally Cross – track based races with multiple competitors.Historic Rally – All the thrills and spills of standard rally mode, but with older, classic vehicles.Within each of the career mode categories there are dozens of lengthy races through which progression is made by earning credits and upgrading not only vehicles, but your entire race team. From engineers and team sponsorship deals to actually upgrading your canteen facilities. All upgrades will have a direct impact on your progression, so each will need to be thought about and coincided carefully.Away from career mode, DiRT 4 offers us Competitive mode. Featuring a handful of daily, weekly and monthly community challenges, this mode sets to pit you against players all over the globe. Those looking for some tough competition and leaderboard setting, this is where you’ll most likely find yourself. Oh, we nearly forgot to mention, the leaderboard is cross-platform!Then you’ll find the Multiplayer mode, wherein you can either join an online session, or create your own private or public game.Freeplay is the next mode, here you can generate a custom championship from the random track generation tool. It’s a nice feature, but we have to question how needed it actually is. It all seems like a bit too much effort for something we suspect is going to be rarely used.DiRT Academy is the penultimate mode. This is your tutorial mode if you will, and what a mode it is. Never before has rallying been explained quite so well as it is in this mode here. Pop into this mode and you’ll be pulling off Scandinavian flicks before you know it.Joyride is the final mode. This is perhaps where the crux of DiRT 3 gameplay is. With Free Roam around a factory setting to Smash Attacks, where you must race around destroying a set number of blocks in a given time, to the stressful Time Attack modes, these are a blast, and there are loads of them. They will also serve as a more fun way to learn the physics of your car. Spend time here as it is very rewarding.Gone are the stupid rewinds and annoying hypeman commentator, two my main complaints about DiRT 3. This feels much more rally than party now and that’s a good thing. The accompanying soundtrack to the in game menus is eclectic to say the least, ranging from Disclosure to Wilkinson,  Queens Of The Stone Age to The Hives, but you’ll find yourself head nodding your way through loadscreens often. A very well chosen set of tracks and with 40 titles, you’ll find something in there you enjoy.I’ve found the graphics to feel slightly dialed down in comparison to other rally games, including DiRT Rally and wonder if it has anything to do with developing and inclusion of the random track generator. If that’s the case, although graphics are by no means the be all and end all of a good game, I personally hope that Codemasters scrap any track generation in rally games going forward (although I’m sure there are some out there who love it) and make them as beautiful as possible instead.In summary DiRT 4 is the perfect rally game for those looking for something entirely less frustrating than a rally sim, but has more bells and whistles than an arcade racer. A fantastic overall package which you’ll come back to endlessly… or at least until Codemasters drop their next big racer!",TheGamesShed

This was a great visual novel. The artwork is stunning. I constantly was looking back at the gallery of images and admiring each work. There are a good amount of images for each character. Every character had great, distinct personalities and stories. The voice acting was great; although it was in Japanese, the intonations that the actors provided always added to the story. The steampunk London setting was stunning; I remember beginning the game and wanting to share how beautiful it looked with anyone around me. The story itself was great.

I smiled and laughed as well; the game leaves players completely invested. You won't want to put it down. Otome games and visual novels aren't for everyone; yet I definitely would suggest this game.

And now, something funny: GGG declares this as a feature to prevent cheating.Partying sounds like fun, if you like dia-shows.Too many skills and character builds cause even high-end computers to drop down to a few frames when playing in a group.The last mini expansion ""The Forsaken Masters"" made it even worse.With this expansion players can have their own personal hideout, a place to rest or sort things in your stash, nothing special because this hideout is only  a small tileset with a few objects like bricks or a wall or a few trees. Guess what happens to your framerate when entering your or other players hideout? But hey........you candecorate your personal hideout with hundreds of objects (of course you can buy them from GGG, but there are also free ones)....guess again what happens to your framerate and loading time ?I forgot weather effects.

While running around you may find kind of a chest box, called strongbox.Introduced in the ""Ambush league"" a few months ago, you'll get ambushed by monsters when opening these boxes.Sounds funny, but.............many computers freeze for 1-2 secs while the game is loading the monsters.

The amount of content in this game is astounding and will keep you invested for months. With over seven hundred cars to get to grips with you’re spoilt for choice, and the best thing is that the customisation is pretty much endless.

The inclusion of loot boxes has had a mixed response, but for me I enjoyed the inclusion of them. Opening loot boxes can be fun and exciting and in my opinion  it adds another layer of replay value to the game. My only gripe with the game is the amount of loading screens you have to battle through, and hopefully the loading times get reduced over time.

My biggest concern with this game was the introduction of new characters. I was worried that they would replace the old ones and not be able to live up to the greats, such as Subzero, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, etc. Fortunately, the old characters are still here and will probably be with us for a long time. Some have aged, yes, but still here. The new characters are wonderful editions! Erron Black is probably my favorite of all the new ones, and the most fun to play as. Sadly, the game does not feature any maps with staged fatalities, babalities, friendships, etc. but it does add new finishing moves, probably the best one since the game was first created, called Quitalities, which occurs when a player quits in the middle of the game due to rage or whatever, the game officially ends, and as the victor, you are rewarded with a Quitality. Hilarious! There are some great new gamemodes, such as King of the Hill, that change to the entire gameplay experience. Krypt mode is as awesome addition, where you can spend in-game currency to unlock new fatalities, brutalities, costumes, etc.Unfortunately, some of the best new characters, such as D'vorah and Ferra/Torr, are really hard to play as and win. Scorpion is an overpowered character, as is Erron Black, and it's frustrating to try and play against them with any other character. Also, while I like the idea of the new character variation system, which adds a variety of different gameplay methods with the same characters, it seems very unbalanced. Some of the characters, such as Cassie Cage and Jacqui Briggs only have one good variation to choose and fight as. This is disappointing, considering I was really hyped for this addition to the game. Also, I was disappointed by the serious lack a diverse set of maps. I suppose the Fighter genre has never had too many, but I wanted more considering this is the next generation. The maps only difference in terms of gameplay variety is the setting and the interactions, and some maps crossover the same interactions, like throwing a fire pyre from a brazier. There is little difference to mention, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's similar to the movement system in Black Ops 3 (Black Ops 2, but you can walk on walls!! Who cares!?) Regardless, it's a minor complaint that I hope Netherrealms and Warner Bros. will address in future titles.Few things I would like for Netherrealms to add in the future, perhaps in upcoming DLCs, would be stage fatalities and more maps! Stage fatalities were a big part of MK9 that made the maps feel more diverse and unique. The interactions are a nice touch, but hardly worth mentioning, in my opinion.The game still suffers from matchmaking connection issues that plagued MK9. I prefer playing splitscreen over online in any Mortal Kombat game, but I know people who love online matchmaking will be pissed off by the connection issues. Hopefully, this gets better in the future.Lastly, I felt the faction system was very underdeveloped. You can choose between five factions, which have there own unique finishing moves, called Faction Kills, which you can unlock by winning battles against other players. Aside from this, that's about it. You may enter in Faction Wars, events that happen every so often, but winning battles for your faction doesn't reward you in any way.Overall, Mortal Kombat is a very good game. One of the best this year, but that's not saying much. The past few years have been plagued with many disappointing titles. This one just manages to not do that.Gameplay = 9/10Story = 7/10Multiplayer = 7/10Other (Graphics, Extras, Soundtrack, Voice Acting, etc.) = 8/10Overall = 8/10",aidanpscott

A lot of skills and strategies to check out. A lot of cutscenes to watch, a lot of amazing music to listen to... A lot of goodness embedded into that small catridge.Game is, long story short, about a conflict between organic and mechanical races, that both live on huge, lifeless giants that used to fight long time ago. The setting of the game juggles epicness, jrpg-like cuteness and... a little bit of shocking, grim atmosphere here and there, since the machines' favourite food are organic races.What is amazing about this game is the number of side-quests and their meaning. You actually get access to a map of people you talked to, and upon discovering connection between them they get connected on the grid with specific relation. You can change/enhance that relations by doing different quests, and those sometimes offer you a choice. Upon doing quests more and more of them are coming. Just finding every npc in the game is challenging task.Areas you're about to explore are vast, interesting, and filled with strong monsters. Music is amazing, and the battle system is easily the best I've ever seen in jrpg.I could go on. The thing is, if you don't have Wii, just go and get this game, it's worth it.

This is a series that provides you with challenging and adrenaline-fuelled action from start to finish and the great sense of achievement you get when defeating an enemy is second to none. As you can imagine back in 2011 when the first Dark Souls game came out it was a game that hooked many and I was one of them many, so when I learnt that the first Dark Souls was being remastered I was excited to say the least. Thankfully they’ve done the first Dark Souls justice with this remaster and it was a pleasure to embark on the fantastic journey all over again. Without a doubt this is the best version of the game and you can see improvements throughout your time with the game, so if you’ve never played a Dark Souls game before then you’re in for a treat. Combat is obviously a major aspect in this series and thankfully it feels better than ever. In my opinion everything feels more fluid when in combat this time around and even though you will experience some frustrating moments from time to time putting the game down is very difficult thanks to its addictive gameplay. If you like lots of varied content then you will absolutely love what this game has to offer and with the added DLC that means you won’t be getting bored anytime soon. You will however notice that the content does have a few bugs and technichal issues contained in it, but thankfully whilst these issues can be annoying none of them are game-breaking so they’re not too problematic. There is however no issues when it comes to the new and improved multiplayer offerings. The multiplayer aspect in the game has seen quite an overhaul and to say I had fun when playing the game in this way would be a massive understatement. Unfortunately though the improved multiplayer is the only new thing really and even though I was more than satisfied playing the same and improved game again it still would’ve been nice to have seen a couple of new features included. I’ve always been a big fan of the Dark Souls presentation style and it was nice to see some improvements included here. Visually the game definitely looks better and in a way the improved visuals make you become even more attached to the gameplay. The same can also be said about the improved sound design because it makes the game even more of an immersive experience. At the end of the day as far as remasters go Dark Souls Remastered is a very good addition to the remastered formula and I really enjoyed experiencing this masterpiece again. They’ve managed to improve the game in a number of areas and even if you’ve played the game before I fully recommend that both newcomers and veterans of the series should purchase Dark Souls Remastered immediately because in my opinion you won’t regret it.",Xbox_Alive

The speed of the game increases WAY too fast until the pieces drop before you can place them. Compounding this, if you actually like playing multiplayer marathon games without garbage (and frankly I can't imagine why you would want to play with garbage on) there's no option for it. Repeating:: There is no way to turn garbage off in multiplayer mode, local or otherwise. If I had read that sentence before buying, I wouldn't have wasted my money. Garbage is stupid, frustrating and basically punishes you for playing the game with someone more skilled than you. In ""The New Tetris"", everyone got the same pieces, and garbage was optional. That way you could all play the game at an enjoyable pace and see who lasted the longest. But for whatever reason instead of mimicking that perfect core gameplay that was nailed in the late 90s, Nintendo has added a bunch of idiotic game modes that are not Tetris in any way except that they feature the familiar Tetris pieces. I would give them 5 seconds of my time if the actual game, Tetris, was what it should be. I hooked up my old N64 just to make sure I wasn't being too hard on this game. I thought maybe too much time had passed and I'd just put the N64 version on a pedestal that it wasn't really deserving of. Nope. The game holds up beautifully. All it needs is hi-res graphics, online play and wireless controllers and it would be golden. Oh, and the Music is better too. I recognize that my comments about this game won't resonate with a lot of people. But for the people who know what I'm talking about, all I can say is: I feel your pain.

There's a very low rate of puzzles and abilities that utilize this new feature. 2) the quest mode can be really frustrating. Sometimes you'll need an item that you have previously sold and can't get back unless you know someone selling it on the WFC shop mode or start the game over. They should've made any quest releated items non-sellable, or allow you to complete the quest even if you do sell them. Also, you can take on 5 quests at a time max, so if you have that quest and can't complete it, you're just stuck and can't pick up any new ones. 3) Selling items is a huge pain, as you are forced to keep one item of everything to prevent the above mentioned quest problem. Even if you did want to sell a bunch of stuff, it doesn't remove your equiped gear from the ""to sell"" list, nor put an E or anything next to it, so you may accidently sell your equipment if you're not paying attention. 4) Way too many enemies (and bosses) are reused...again 5) The story is really comedy/anime driven and this proves to be a major distraction and seems very out of place given the timeframe of the game (WW2). 6) Promise of co-op play is only limited to boss rush mode. 7) 95% of the items and abilities are worthless or just clones of one another. 8) Re-used stages (or similar looking levels) within the game. You'd think the portraits would bring in some new variety, but the only really different type of level is the pyramid level. Most of the others just look like any other CV castle. While still playable and sometimes enjoyable, this game definitely is the worse CV title since Harmony of Dissonance. Some of the levels and all the new enemies are cool, and so is the dual character mode. But for the above mentioned reasons this game fails to live up to Castlevania's previous body of work.

It's the kind of game where developers take 1 step forward and 2 steps back, despite their passionate effort in 'reinventing' the genre. Length: ""Splinter Cell: Conviction's"" story modeI have been a massive fan of the Splinter Cell series, beginning with the first title that was released for the original Xbox. My play through with Splinter Cell: Conviction was, to say the least, average. It's the kind of game where developers take 1 step forward and 2 steps back, despite their passionate effort in 'reinventing' the genre. Length: ""Splinter Cell: Conviction's"" story mode will last the average player an upwards of around 6-10 hours, depending on the difficulty (mind you, this is not the same ""lengthy"" duration they claimed and boasted in their interviews. The Co-op portion of the title will last approximately 3-4 hours, again, depending on the difficulty. The rest of the multiplayer length is relatively subjective, because it really depends on the person playing and whether they truly enjoy it or not.Controls: Excellent. Some issues with trying to climb up and some such but other than that, the controls were very solid.Sound: Again, also excellent.  Single Player Story: Not too much peep out of me for this part of the game. It's a pretty interesting storyline, but I wish they did a few things differently. In short - and without spoiling too much - it's just obnoxious playing as Sam Fisher one moment, and than being thrown into Diwaniya, Iraq as a completely different person. It just derails the narrative focus of the game for the sake of telling a side story that is completely irrelevant to the main plot of the game. Co-op Story: Interesting to say the least. It really reveals a lot of the interior motives of a certain someone in the single player story, but only if you play the co-op campaign first. The ending was truly a disappointment although my friend and I had a pretty good laugh the first time we played the ending. Gameplay and design: Now, this is where it gets really nitty-gritty. The game-play and overall design of Conviction is quite clear, it's meant to be played as a run and gun, Jason Bourne on speed style game. There are a huge amount of key and refining features missing that made the originals so damn good. The knife, whistling, controlling your light exposure and movement speed, Night/thermal vision goggles, moving and hiding bodies, hallway split jumping, etc. Big and small things like the ones I mentioned above are just completely eradicated from Conviction, all for the sake of making it fast paced, something the Splinter Cell series is *not* known for. Enemies are just thrown into each section of the level, each one being in a convenient spot for players to make full use of the Mark and Execute feature. So much is sacrificed for one feature, and quite frankly, it's just disgusting to see a title stripped of it's roots and garnished with mediocrity.The exclusion of key features is one thing, but the illusion of the stealth in conviction is also another. I couldn't shake the feeling that Conviction was not designed with the originals in mind. For all intents and purposes, Ubisoft felt it would be a good idea to force players into unavoidable gun fight scenarios with little hope for pure stealth. The addition of the Sonar Goggles is more of a burden than it is a boon. Special enemy types are later equipped with these very same goggles, further eliminating the use of stealth mechanics and forcing players to draw their guns and mark/execute their way to victory. These same goggles also completely eliminate the use of one such gadget, the sticky camera (which had it's smoke feature replaced with the explode feature).I can go on about how this isn't a true sequel to the Splinter Cell series but this review has to stop at some point and I'm just sick of having to juggle why Ubisoft felt it necessary to try and reinvent the wheel. For me, this title in the series is a 5/10. In short, as a Splinter Cell title, Conviction is complete trash that spits in the face of it's predecessor in hopes of garnering the undivided attention of the fast-paced shooter crowd. As a 3rd person shooter with some stealth elements, it's an average game. Make of that what you will.",Motsie

The AI is completely broken, your teammates will either be catching long bombs without looking or bobbling easy passes to the chest. The adaptive difficulty doesn't work the way its suppose to, it rewards you for playing well by making your teammates play horribly. Superstar mode is a tedious affair, you don't feel that you're making progress as your stats go up since the game makes you play horribly no matter how good your guy is. Online is full of whiners and quitters, about 90% of my games resulted in the other person quitting or leaving it on pause. The graphic are alright, not the best but not horrible enough to distract. The animation is poor, especially the running (watch in slow motion). The menus are good, sometimes poorly laid out but usable. Controls are overly complex and sometimes are not responsive, this makes passing a hassle and could make you miss a good throwing opportunity. Also, sometimes my QB would run for a false start when I fake hut the ball (probably a glitch with the AI). This is a very unpolished game with major problems, mainly bad AI and controls, some may be fixed through patches. This is a rental if you like football games (though there's not much choice), anyone else should stay away.",DonM.

""Saving a lot of data...""The much awaited 4th generation of Pokemon games has arrived. And everything fans expected is here, like trading Pokemon and battling through Wi-Fi connection with real people all around the world, seeing day turn into night and so on with a real-time clock working just like in the GBC, around 100 brand new monsters (including new babies), new ways for the Pokemon to evolve (some of them unpredictable), and all that stuff we already know (you may like it or not). But little problems still make the game experience a little tiring.As always you start the game in a small town receiving your first pokemon from a professor and your adventure goes on as you become a trainer. You must search for new Pokemon species intending to fulfill the Pokedex and also capturing and raising them through battling other trainers to challenge the Gym Leaders and the Elite Four. This storyline is still the same since the 1st generation of the series ten years ago (and it really has no need for a change); but things evolve, and some little problems were left aside because the developers fear major changes--or just because they are lazy.What is better in this new generation? Wi-Fi is awesome, but it was almost an obligation; day turning into night is great (and beautiful), but Game Freak is just apologizing for not including this in the 3rd generation games; splitting all kind of moves in special type or physical type is an important change, and it's a good improvement in battling strategies; good new moves--especially the bug-type ones since bugs always needed stronger moves; Poke Radar (for Pokemon searching) is cool; digging and seeking other trainers in the Underground is funny; slathering honey in the barks to attract wild Pokemon is great; making Poffins using the touch-screen is a fair step ahead PKBlocks; new interesting berries effects; and East Sea/West Sea Shellos rocks. Almost there?There are little things that were supposed to make the game better, but... They just don't work that fine. The graphics in the towns are great, beautiful 3D buildings, etc. but what about the monsters? Why they look just a little better than in the GBA? The Poketch is a good idea, but most of the apps are useless or buggy. When you're battling other trainer you can just touch the move you want your Pokemon to use; but when you need to know the power or accuracy of a move during the battle you need to enter the Pokemon screen, and then select the ""moves"" page. Come on, they have an entire screen to display that info! (At least they should put a little ""info"" button beside the ""move"" button just like Nintendo did in Brain Age's training menu.) And why managing items is still annoying when you have a touch screen? I would like to exchange items between my Pokemon by just dragging the item here and there, but I need to select ""Pokemon"", ""item"", ""take"", then select other ""Pokemon"", ""item"", ""give"", and search for the item I want to give (it will be in the last position in the list since it was the last item that entered the bag... and I must roll all the scrollbar over until I can get there). Shouldn't it be more simple?And some other... tiring things. Crossing Mt. Coronet through cave and blizzard is unnecessarily unforgiving... Contests are much less technical than it used to be... Dressing? Dancing? I bet girls like it. Not me. :P ""Saving a lot of data...""? Are they kidding me??? And why they need to ask ""There is already a save file. It is OK to overwrite it?"" all the time? There is just one save slot! And (last one) it should bring more options to accelerate the battles, just like in the Advance Wars series, for instance. I don't like to play a game for about 150 hours and see that 50 hours were spent slowly reading ""The sandstorm rages."", ""Roselia is bufetted by the sandstorm!"", mumble, mumble. (My suggestion: a system with arrows poping up and down quickly for poison, hail, leech seed, swift swim, etc. At least as an animation option.)Kinda sad for me to say I think it was my last new Pokemon game.

The cream of the crop is the multiplayer and The Last Stand where you take on hordes of monsters with 2 other heroes. Great additions all way round. Long story short, yes it is a massive departure from DoW1's style but it is fortunately just as good in its own right.

Tekken Tag Tournament is the first instalment of the ""Tag"" series and brings back previous characters from the earlier Tekken games. The graphics have certainly boosted up a notch from the PS1 and Arcade versions, some of the stages are fantastic - pyramid temples, colosseum's and dojos. Gameplay is still the same as before, but there are some new fighting moves, different game modes to play and for the first time you can play as not one, but two characters in each fight. Not all characters are available to start off with, you have to unlock them in Arcade mode. Fight your way through 8 different stages by kicking, punching and wrestling each opponent and you will unlock a new character as well as a nice short theatre clip from each character you complete Arcade in. If you've played Tekken before, then most of the moves you'll know already but if you're new to the series, you may want to get some practicing done in Practice mode. You can change the difficulty settings if want to challenge yourself and become a master at the game. Of course this game wouldn't be Tekken without (my personal faviroute) multiplayer, where you and your friend can choose two different characters (4 altogether). Another new feature to this game is if you have a Multitap, you can have up to 4 players to make it even more enjoyable. You and your friends can get loads of aggressive fun, competing against one another to become the champion. If that wasn't enough for you why not play a much relaxing game of bowling, yes you heard me right bowling, something you might wanna try if you have a bad headache after all that anger and shouting from multiplayer. One thing that disappoints me is even though you can use two characters tag in each fight, the round ends after one of them is defeated rather than finish them both off. This would have been a nice option to let you configure this. Usually I would get bored of the same old repetitive fighting but it still manages to charm for the fourth time running.",Neo010390

It's weakerA solid (and sometimes standout) game but it's nowhere near as good as the first.Guacamelee is one of my favourite metroidvania/2D games ever along with Hollow Knight. I completed it to 100% along with its DLCs on my PS Vita. Unfortunately, while Guacamelee 2 can be fun a lot of times, overall it feels like a step back compared to its amazing predecessor in multiple ways. It's weaker but not just because of that, but because it also fails to improve and fix some of the first game's problems after 5 years.Pros:* The new additions to the gameplay are all good. Powers, such as the Pollo Shot or the Eagle Hook are welcome additions that help the game to feel fresh even after a long period of time. The skill system was a great idea as well, the different skills manage to add another layer of depth to the combat.* I loved how the game handled some of its secrets, how great the Easter Eggs were, how self-reflective the game was. I liked when the game basically broke the fourth wall and I liked when it criticised modern gaming practices in a smart way. There are tons of cool hidden details overall in the game. I also loved many of the funny dialogues too.* I had a lot of fun with the game when it worked. When the difficulty was just right - both in combat and platforming - and I was able to steadily progress forward. In these cases, Gucamelee 2 truly shined and got close to the quality level of the first.* For the most part, the audiovisual design is very good here as well, similarly to the first title. The areas feel fairly distinct and the soundtrack manages to enhance the atmosphere of the game.* The campaign takes 14 hours to complete to 100%.Cons:* The game's pacing is way worse than the first one's. Mainly how it handles the introduction of new and old abilities, how frequently it ups and how it changes the difficulty of platforming sections, or how much it relies on backtracking.* The levels are more complex than in the first game, yet I feel that I have a smaller sense of discovery, maybe because this game doesn't rely as much on backtracking. I was able to pick most of the collectibles up without going back to previous places after I unlocked new abilities.* It's illogical that I can only fast travel to talking stones and not to checkpoints (that are marked with a skull on the map). This is just an unnecessary barrier that makes exploring even harder and more tedious, it just serves as an artificial game time-extender. You need to spend a lot of time in order to get to a previously inaccessible hidden chest.* The difficulty curve just isn't right. While I was able to complete the game to 100%, I almost always felt that the game was harder than it should be, mainly when it came to its platforming sections. Maybe because of that, the game a lot of times felt more frustrating and boring than fun. For example, the game throw complex platforming parts at me after 30 minutes of playing that I only saw in the first game after 10 hours of gameplay. There are a lot of platforming sections that simply feel bad and unbalanced - the best example is The Crucible that you have to beat in order to get the good ending, but before that, you also need to get 5 Special Keys to open The Crucible and those keys are tied to some annoying trials.* To add to the previous point, a lot of sections feel badly designed because of the controls. These have some problems. In the first game, it was possible to stick to a wall by holding Y/Triangle. This way it was easier to jump up between two horizontal walls. In the second game, you need to hold the stick to the wall's direction in order to stay on it. It can be very problematic and confusing when you need to continuously jump up in a weird rhythm and avoid undodgeable traps. It can also be a big problem when you need to do things fast because this either slows you down or somehow makes it so the game won't detect your next input (a good example is one of the Special Key challenges in which you need to kill the bombers before they explode). The chicken controls aren't the best either, because the chicken is extremely sensitive/overly responsive. This problem really becomes obvious when you need to fly with the chicken between those green spikes in tight spaces.* While Guacamelee 2 has some interesting additions, it still doesn't really feel like a proper sequel. In roughly the first third of it, I was extremely bored - it just felt like a rehash of Guacamelee and overall a worse game. Everything I've seen there basically was already done and/or done better in Guacamelee previously - including different game mechanics, music, etc. After that, the game opens up and gets more interesting, but it never manages to fully capture the magic of the original.* Sometimes it was hard to locate my character on the screen in combat-heavy scenarios, but this is a minor complaint compared to the other ones.Rating: 8/10 - Solid Game",DaemonXHUN

The campaign is long and challenging, which is good, excluding the Scrin campaign which was only 4 missions. While playing through the campaign you are presented with HD cinematics (before, after and during missions) which are fairly cheesy and unconvincing, however, it's better then nothing.

The graphics, although not perfect, are very nice. In addition to the graphics is the neat sound design which is usually overlooked, so I suggest pumping up the volume. Balance wise, the game seems to be almost balance in patch 1.09, except for a few units, so if you're playing still with pre-1.09, I highly suggest you download the patch because it changes several major gameplay mechanics such as the economy which cutsdown ""spamming"" by a lot. Bottom line, if you have ever liked any C&C game, or you like RTS games in general, then I highly suggest you buy this because your missing out on a good game.",JohnS.

1004,Aliens Versus Predator 2,PC,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        It's been more than ten years since the game's release. It's been really a while, but it seems as if just yesterday I put AVP 2 in my CD-ROM. Being disappointed with the first game but having hoped that sequel would be better I started playing I don't remember as who  The storyline was again divided into 3 lines for different creatures. And believe me, each line could be a standalone game for number of reasons. Different approach of gameplay, different stages, different thinking made me enjoy every minute of the game. Developers allowed players to save at any moment, so a gamer could explore each level without fear of being suddenly killed. Level design was at its best. Playing as Alien you could climb the walls, practise jumps, feel yourself as a beast after all. Alien could be played starting with a facehugger. First level ended by finding a sleeping human who's face you are willing to jump on, second started with breaking human's chest and finding more ""food"" to get strength. Basically a gamer had opportunity to play in all forms of alien creatures. Some levels for alien storyline were just huge and it was easy to forget that you were not in an openworld game.Predator had more gadgets and weapons that allowed to have more various gameplay. Somehow the most memorable moment was the one where predator was captured and everything was taken from it. It was difficult not to feel naked without regular staff. Marine missions were more dramatic that in an original game. The arsenal was significantly expanded and it gave original well balanced guns that allowed you to enjoy the game even more. Playing as marine you start alone on a level that has no enemies. But until you know it, you will be scared of every sound (you do remember the pipe's steam, don't you?). Later on the game marine is put in a prison cell and having only a knife in the world of powerful beasts will make everyone scared to death. Final mission allows you to pick up weaponry in any amount and lets you to stand against a horde of enemies, the scene that stuck in my mind as one of the most challenging.Story was easy to get in and difficult to forget. Even now I have a sense of guilt because there was a woman character left behind at the end of the game.It seemes that singleplayer accomplishes to give opportunity to be in any situation possible that was shown in the movies or that you could imagine. Multiplayer is not a part of game that a gamer like me usually appreciates. But given it a try, it kept both me and my friends playing for hours. Multiplayer's gameplay required to team up with your species to provide successful game. Although some levels were not well balanced and playing as a marine was a nightmare it was difficult not to enjoy the game. Different types could be selected for each species. Predators had different armor, aliens were also various (even facehugger made everyone scared),  marines could select spawn weapon set to make hell around. There were four of us usually playing, me as a predator, one alien and two marines on garage map that gave us tons of fun.In conclusion it must be said, that the game is not innovative anyhow, but it is still perfect.",igor-qwe

It gives plenty of challenge while still allowing you to beat the computer and make minor mistakes. On normal you can actually get by just button mashing, but if your going to want to be good you'll have to learn the awesome (but hard) counter system. For the pros there is a hard and very hard mode. Some things I hate about the game are the amazingly fast battles and the extreme shifts in difficulty. If your unlucky the computer can take you out in as much as 3-4 hits. Sometimes the computer will be near unbeatable, countering you from the start, while at other times they will be unable to attack you if you are able to slam them into walls long enough. Story mode also doesn't take very long to beat, but is actually pretty satisfying due to its hilarious and beautiful cinematics. This game also has many different characters to choose from. Though I wish they were all a little more different. As it stands there are only really 4 ""kinds"" of characters: the really fast women, the really slow but powerful men (mostly), people who are in between, and then the crazy drunken fighter who is just hilarious to watch. If you have friends and 2 controllers and you love fighting games go out and buy this title. If you sort-of-maybe like fighting games, or play solo most of the time just rent this title. If you hate getting frustrated at times, want a carefree, easy stress free game, don't like memorizing button combinations, and can not adapt to the fast pace of a fighting game DO NOT BUY IT.

This is Chaos Reborn.Updated for version 1.00.Summary: Fast-Paced Wizard Chess With RNGYou start in an arena with one to three other wizards. You have one of several staffs and a plethora of spells. You can summon hordes of creatures and send them into battle while you support them with your magic. Or cast Divine Blade, hop aboard a manticore, and challenge the enemy wizards in personal combat. You can bluff by summoning creatures as illusions. Entrap hostile monsters with the gooey blob. Singe your opponent's eyebrows with a magic bolt. There is a great deal of strategy involved, but luck also plays a big role in the game, making every match unique.The Luck FactorEvery spell you cast has a percent chance to succeed. Every attack you make has a percent chance to kill. There are no hit points in Chaos Reborn. An action is either wildly successful or a dismal failure. This makes for exciting swings in fortune! One moment you might be sitting on top of the world because you've cornered your opponent with a sapphire dragon, unicorn, and giant spider. Suddenly, your opponent's magic bolt kills your spider, your opponent runs the unicorn through with her sword, and your opponent's rat somehow manages to slay your dragon (an 8% chance!). Now you're on the back foot and have to do some fast thinking to salvage the situation.The luck factor can create some ridiculously funny situations in Chaos Reborn. My most fun and memorable games have involved wild swings in fortune. That being said, careful planning is still a very important aspect of the game. You must be constantly aware of your chances, maximize your odds, and prepare a backup plan in case lady luck doesn't go your way. Bluffing can also help control the influence of luck. (See below.)Bluffing!Although all spells have a percent chance to fail, you can choose to cast any creature as an illusion and automatically be successful 100% of the time. An illusion behaves precisely like a ""real"" creature: it can attack, defend, fly, and carry you around on its back if it is a mount. But perhaps an enemy wizard suspects that huge dragon you summoned last turn is an illusion. He casts Disbelieve on your dragon and it vanishes in a puff of smoke. That's the downside to using illusions. If the dragon had been real, the Disbelieve spell would have failed and your opponent would have wasted his turn! If you are a great bluffer, you can probably get away with summoning lots of illusory creatures. If you are a very perceptive person you can probably deduce which creatures your opponents have summoned as illusions and Disbelieve them!GraphicsI am a big fan of the graphics in this game. The art direction is distinctive and avoids the typical visual cliches associated with well-known fantasy creatures like unicorns and dwarves. Spells and creatures identifying with the concept of Law tend to have cool colors and a rigid crystalline appearance. Spells and creatures identifying with the concept of Chaos tend to have warm colors and an ""entropic"" aesthetic. If you like unique art direction, you will love this. If you prefer predictable visuals that you can easily associate with character models from other games, this will probably not be your cup of tea.More to Come!There is a great deal more to be added in the coming months. There will be a social rank system with orders (guilds), demi-gods, and gods. Have you ever wanted to be a God? Well start gathering your worshipers because you will have that chance in Chaos Reborn!What the Game Is NotSome folks seem to be under the impression that this is a deck-building game similar to Magic: the Gathering. It really isn't. Chaos Reborn does not have thousands of spells to choose from, and you will probably never have full control over the ""deck"" of spells that you bring into duels.While this game is clearly a ""10"" for me, I also realize it is not for everybody. If you do not like turn-based games, or you dislike random number generator mechanics, this game might not be your cup of tea.",Sephorin

Assassin’s Creed Origins has without a doubt rejuvenated the series, and whilst it still has a few problems it’s still one of the best Creed games I’ve played in years. The combat system seems to have had a complete overhaul and in my opinion this is the best combat I’ve ever played in a Creed game. They’ve also done a great job with the mission variety in the game and I never once got bored on a mission because they made each mission matter. I was however a little disappointed with the stealth sequences in the game, and the main reason why I was disappointed is that I think they’ve made the stealth to easy this time around. The world of Egypt has been created to perfection and it’s absolutely massive so be prepated to explore quite a lot, which is great considering exploring is fun and very interesting. The story in the game is fantastic, exciting and most important of all interesting throughout, and in my opinion this is definitely one of the best story’s the series has had so far. The presentation side of the game is amazing and packed full of fantastic detail, especially when it came to the visuals. The game looks stunning and the amount of effort gone into here is really evident, and this effort makes the world come alive which is awesome.

You can literally drive right through the middle of the paint, straight to the hole and the center won't even turn to look at you. The XBOX Live experience is horrible. Of the 10 games I played online, every single time I lost voice with my opponent. The graphics are noticeably degraded when playing online as well. EA should have just released a slam dunk contest game and I would have been happy! Worth the price of $19.99, but in no way worth $40 bucks.",BobD.

I would say while I like fighters, I would have to be a casual gamer, and I am really doubting if I should every actually keep the game.  The fighting is solid, but I don't know how to do the flashy techniques that I would see in gameplay videos... why? Because there is no true tutorial mode. Mission mode is a chore, even going through it, I still don't understand how to do half of these things. I was also hoping for (the as promised) story mode, but Capcom somehow did not follow through.  There is just arcade mode.....and thats it.Finally the character roster is alright, not the best.  They were leaning towards more well known, modern games for Capcom and I guess whoever Marvel wanted for their side. Yet the charm for Marvel vs Capcom 1/2 was the combination on these completely random characters.  In removing veterans like Megaman (in which including NONE of his incarnations makes no sense), Captain Commando, Strider and Jin, the legacy of Capcom is kinda just not there.  Hell, they go and include MODOK and Dormammu ascharacters when its obvious that casuals wouldnt know who the hell they were, why does this then apply to Capcom characters? Makes no sense.Anyway this game just doesn't work for me. As a basic fighter it is spot on, but as an overall package it is lacking.  I recently bought Power Stone Collection for PSP and I found that alot more fulfilling an experience for a game thats around 10 years old.

You are in command of a squad of soldiers, each equipped with different weapons, from shotguns through sniper rifles all the way to rocket launchers. The game has a good tutorial which can make a person understand the basic and more advanced tactics - from the standard take cover tactics to the more advanced search and destroy where each member of the squad covers the blind spot of the other and thus advance in their search for the enemies. Afterwards people can chose whether they want to advance to the campaign, practice against the computer in skirmish matches or go online against other people around the world.

Setting the bar last year with their first release of an NBA Jam game in almost 15 years, the team at EA score big with this new update from last year's already solid title. Tim Kitzrow is back to make me laugh so hard at his commentary I have to occasionally stop and pause the game until I recover from laughing at his one-liners. Also returning, as the title suggests, are the most recent NBA rosters and players from today and from years past, returning as ""Legends"", who will play with a slew of wacky unlockable teams that are sure to keep you busy well until the NBA season will end (despite the lingering blackout...). New this year are improved graphics, with smoother animations and even sweeter visual effects (being on fire, new trick & dunk moves) that blow last year out of the water. Also updated are a few game changers: on top of being ""on fire"" by scoring 3 baskets in a row, Team Fire now sets you and your teammate ""on fire"" when you successfully complete 3 alley-oops in a row without letting the opposing team score. There's now also ""Razzle Dazzle"" moves implemented in the game, which take trick moves, shots and shoves and add a little flare to them in-game, such as rolling the ball on your shoulders or shooting the ball granny-style (which is absolutely gut-busting seeing for the first time). Campaign has now been renamed and redone, being named ""Road Trip"", in which you must beat each team in the NBA, with Bronze, Silver and Gold medals to win for each team depending on how many times you play that team. Being able to choose a team that fits your needs for each game you play is a step in a good direction from last year, which only allowed you to play as one team for every franchise file you saved, which tended to get boring. The last major addition is Jam Central, which contains a store to buy players and customizations for your game card, challenges to help you level up and use points in the store, and friend leaderboards. There are so many ways to level up in this game, it'll be hard to be stuck not knowing how to level up next.Feeling like you're a part of the player  with and without the ball in a basketball game is essential, and it seems as though EA has learned a thing or two from last year. Despite the AI still being a bit on the soft side for more hardcore fans, there's plenty here to go around for everyone. For those who love being able to play basketball, but aren't interested in the learning curve that NBA 2K12 may have on new players, NBA Jam OFE has one of those ""easy to learn, hard to master"" attributes, which appeal to newcomers and experts alike, and for $15 on PSN and Xbox Live alike, the price is a hell of a lot better than what it was at a year ago, and so much more has been put in this year. If you liked the experience last year with NBA Jam, you owe it to yourself to at least try OFE as a trial, but if you're like me, you won't need to even try it. This is an impulse buy, and a needed one at that for a much more reasonable price.",tlynde11

The game is a technical marvel imo, the light effects, the animations, the weather, the impressive summons... Everything looks amazing and seems really nice ported to me, although I didn’t play the original in console. I’m sure it’s not flawless, but I don’t think you will complain of this aspect.Setting: the world is as big and beautiful as it is wasted and lifeless. This is not a map worth exploring and most of what you see is simply a decorative element oriented to make your car travels more pleasant. Yes, there are some dungeons here and there, and yes, there are some boss-like monsters to kill, but even with those, the whole thing was just not worth the time for me. My advice: just focus on the main story and if you happen to stumble with one of those funny elements in your way, by all means enjoy. The side quests are no better and seem to be taken from a mmorpg (go here and kill these bugs or collect these objects), lacking any narrative to them, and so I had to pretend they didn’t exist and totaly ignored them from chapter 3 onwards, really. To compensate (a little bit) for this lackluster boring world, the enligsh dubbing was really good and the FF-style music didn’t disappoint.Gameplay: likely the best about the game is its combat system which never gets boring and slowly grows more technical and flashy, just at the right peace, if only I’ve always felt everything was a little too easy, despite playing in the maximum difficulty. Sadly, the combat is the only outstanding element of the whole (game)play. Once you finish a battle, things get boring pretty fast and they can be summarized in auto-driving the car, often going over and over to places you have already been, with nothing to do in between this drives, in a world that is so full of barriers (both invisible and physical) that makes you wonder if you can really call it “open world” to begin with.Story: now, if the world is not well thought out, the story is even less, which you can imagine is quite a disappointment, knowing that the Final Fantasy franchise is known for its amazing narratives. How to explain. The adventure looks good in the surface and promising at the start (yes, so did the map) and there are some flashy moments here and there that caught my attention, but once you step back a little and ponder, you realize the whole thing is just too shallow (again, like the world), the storyline never gets to take off and honestly, it barely holds together, constantly resorting to far-fetched plot devices to move itself forward, often initiating or ending events without explanation (or with really unconvincing ones) instead of coherently chaining them with elegance just as a Final Fantasy should. Regarding the characters, including the protagonist and his friends, it is sufficient to say that they are surrounded by such an air of frivolousness that it made me difficult, almost impossible, to connect with them emotionally, despite the tons and tons of camera time they get. Things get more climatic in the very last chapter, but one chapter alone can not make up for 40 hours of inconsistencies.So, how good it is? Well, as a game: an ok experience. As a Final Fantasy? Certainly lackluster. 7.5/10",Soujirop

1071,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Chaos Rising",PC,10," Chaos Rising is a great addition to DoW2. The single player campaign is very intense and really refelcts the Warhammer: 40, 000 lore. The RPG elements of it make u attached to ur units and the pursuit of better wargear really has u coming back for more. The option to be evil and become corrupt or noble and stay true to the Space Marines, also adds to the replayability of the SP campaign. Chaos Rising is a great addition to DoW2.

The RPG elements of it make u attached to ur units and the pursuit of better wargear really has u coming back for more. The option to be evil and become corrupt or noble and stay true to the Space Marines, also adds to the replayability of the SP campaign. The SP campaign has also ditched some of the tedious missions from the original, it has some really unique missions that are the best i've seen since Warcraft 3!!(none of that uninspired ""destroy enemy base to win the mission"" type stuff, really unique mission designs). l Multiplayer has been imrpoved w/ the addition of Chaos faction, which in itself is a badass and exciting faction to play. All users recieve the new units that come with CR for all the other factions, and the addition of new unis for last stand and free for all MP mode makes this a must have game. Relic is renowned for continuing to support its games after releasing it, unlike other developers, and DoW2 and Company of Heroes are testaments to that fact! Graphics are absolutely gorgeous and u dont need a power house of a computer to enjoy them, its without a doubt the best looking RTS on the market. Sound is exciting and heart thumping & add to the atmosphere. W/ all that said, this is without a doubt the best expansion i've played in ages. If u loved DoW2 this is a must buy, if u love RTS games this is a must buy, and if didnt care for the original it'll definitly suck u in w/ all the additions.",SteveM

The first iteration of Far Cry was, while not necessarily perfect, a solid first person shooter. It's big, beautiful world let you approach the varied missions using a variety of tactics making it challenging and giving a sense of achievement. After I played this extremely beautiful game for about 15 hours (I tried so hard to like it), I was very disappointed and felt frustrated that the majority of my actions in the world made little or no difference. For example, I laughed hard when I annihilated one of the infinite-random-henchman-emplacements drove around the next corner and thought, ""I wonder how long 'til the henchmen return?"" So I turned around and went back only to find the infinite-random-henchman-emplacement teaming with life again. Not a corpse, nor blood stain in sight (Realism, anyone?)! This was my experience when I drove to a mission, when I drove away from a mission, and when I just wanted to drive around looking at the scenery. I laughed at the utterly pathetic plight of my avatar. I agree with Samuel W. This is a disgraceful sequel to a worthy first person shooter. Tetris has what some may not even call graphics and is repetitive yet challenging and extremely fun to play. Far Cry 2 is the most beautiful, repetitive, and mind-numbingly tedious game I have ever played. Poor form. Go play Crysis, the true sequel to Far Cry, and leave this third rate third world game well alone.",RichardH

There aren't really any differences between this and the PS3 version (maybe sony fanboys trolling? idk doesn't matter), so you're getting the same thing you're getting with the PS3 version, with small differences in the trophy system and online system. Anyways - about the game; it's a solid sequel to Arena that does everything better, putting Arena to the pits. I found the music to be great, especially hearing the new tracks and old ones mixed so well together (though there wasn't too much in terms of new soundtracks, other than the main themes for new characters and some other ones). The graphics are smooth, great, and the gameplay is fluid and fun. Although I'm not a big fan of 2D fighters, the gameplay was easy enough to learn, meaning that even a noob can pick this game up and have fun. The story mode is great, but only transcends 'your average story' if you've played through at least 1 or 1.5 of the games (part of P3 or part of P4). The menus are really stylish, character portraits are beautiful in HD, the extras are nice albeit a bit tricky to view at a quick pace. Overall, the length of the game isn't that long, but the high amount of replayability from the Golden (straight battles 50+ in a row with rpg dungeon-like stats), Arcade, and Online modes + 2 player local helps extend the length of this game to a great extent. Highly recommended from me, and once more - ignore that hideous user score this game has (only on the X360 version)!Gameplay: 9.5/10Story: 9/10Music: 9/10Presentation: 8.5/10Length: 8/10Overall: 8.5/10",GoombaJMR

And if you go to the barrows (Or whatever they are called) you might never leave. I myself, for example, moved over to Solstheim because of stronger monsters, and cool quests. If you're lower level, you shouldn't complain with some wolves or bears, and for higher levels there are those nasty Spriggans (Keep respawning after getting killed! Grah.) For extremely high levels, you might want to seek out some werewolves, and possibly become one yourself, and then kill without being suspected! Best od EVUH! Better than Tribunal all the way!

I've decided to raise my score to a 5, but unfortunately, I don't think FM14 will reach any higher. Its not because its a bad game by any means, its because its the same game as 2013. Some things are better, like match engine (offensive) and the loading speeds but others are actually worse, like simple language translations, defending, removal of sliders and fancy animations that doesn't make any sense. Sadly, most things behind the scenes remain unchanged. No money for assistants, reputation doesn't scale properly with team success and of course the graphics and sounds (worse) that stays relatively unchanged year after year.Is it a good game? I guess it is. Is it worth the price tag? definitely not. This looks and feels more like a $15 DLC package than a full priced game. Can you imagine a team spent a whole year on this?! I cant, all I see is a handful of people pressing a few buttons every year and then laugh all the way to the bank. Its gone 2 weeks and they haven't even released an update fixing some of the obvious bugs that people are having (they are to busy sipping tequilas I guess).

Maybe in a year this will be the expansion that is described on the box. For now it's just another half completed attempt to squeeze a few dollars out of the Everquest fan base before the next wave of MMORPGs are released.,DainA.

With aBrave new world is the latest expansion for Civilization V, packed with new civilizations, wonders, units and a plethora features. For a hefty price of $30, Civilization V also gets a slight aesthetic refinement for the interface.One of my main complaints with Civilization V Gods and Kings was the amount of multiplayer bugs the game contained and how boring late game can get. With a recent patch, multiplayer actually runs much faster. From loading times to turn times, there was clearly optimizations for multiplayer. Late game is also a lot more interesting. Firaxis has completely retooled how Ideologies work, how the culture victory is obtained, and has reintroduced the World Congress (UN in Civ IV).Ideologies are now obtained by building three factories which signals the industrial era for your civilization, or reaching the Modern Era in the Technology tree. Ideologies now play a big part in civilization. From diplomatic relationships being strained, to unhappiness in your civilization, to revolution. It’s entirely what the game was lacking, and this retooling of ideologies really adds depth to the late game. There tends to be a lot of bickering between the AI as a result, which leads to very interesting gameplay. My first game in Brave New World resulted in a world war. Something also noticeable is no longer does each political ideology have 5 social policies to adopt, but a dozen or more. In fact, each social policy gained from your specific ideology only grants one bonus, instead of several like in Gods and Kings.It requires significantly more culture to get all the benefits from a ideology tree, but this isn’t a problem. It’s very easy to obtain culture, with the addition of great writers/musicians/painters. All of which can create great works, which can bring in tourism from other civilizations. This leads into the new Culture victory, with the goal of being culturally influential to a specific number of civilizations. This is by far one of the best changes in the expansion.The World congress is a more in-depth UN from Civilization IV. You can enact trade embargoes, ban specific luxury resources, enact a world ideology or religion, or even ban nukes. Depending on how you tell your delegates to vote on a issue, can result in some hatred from other civilizations. I once was given the option of voting for a world fair, adopting a world religion, or abstaining my votes for that session of congress. I places all my delegates for the world fair, and as a result I got denounced by the majority of civilizations in the game. It was quite interesting to see who my friends were after that, and this is by far a great addition to Civilization V.Some other noteworthy additions is the inclusion of trade routes, which allows religious pressure, gold, science, food and production to be traded amongst your cities or other civilizations. Spies have the option of being a diplomat, which grants the same abilities only they do not steal technology and they can increase tourism to your cities via propaganda.Overall, the expansion is well worth the price. Most of the additions help late game, although features such as trade routes can help with early expansion. Brave new world also introduces the features very slowly, in such a pace that it’s easy to quickly understand the new gameplay mechanics. This might be the best Civilization to date.",elendiel7

There are two new modes for Diamond Dynasty users.  One is called conquest and allows users to play against the CPU to earn some of the best legends available in this year's release for their Diamond Dynasty Team.  The developers weren't stingy with rewards either.  Playing this mode allows users that prefer offline gameplay to earn some of the best legends in the game (among them Ichiro Suzuki and Tony Gwynn).  The animations are smoother and more realistic than last year.  There are animations and gameplay situations that could use smoother transitions to create more realistic gameplay but these do not detract at all from the single player experience at all.  Some of the still rigid and slow transitions in infield fielding and throws to the cutoff man are exploited in by some users in online gameplay.  One of the unique features that sets MLB The Show apart from other sports games is Sounds of the Show.  Sounds of the Show allow users to set walkup music, home run music and chants for each player in the MLB for a more realistic gameplay experience. The game allows you to import 511 mp3s from a USB into the game's jukebox.  This way when I play and feel like listening to music instead of the commentary, which is outstanding, I can listen to a shuffled playlist in game of an set of songs I choose.One of the unique features of MLB The Show's Diamond Dynasty mode (similar to FIFA's FUT and NBA 2K's MyTeam) is that purchased in-game currency can be used to buy packs AND players.  This way if you dislike the gambling aspect of buying packs, you can purchase a calculable amount of ""stubs"" and purchase the team you want.  All modes of the game are entertaining and have high re-playability.  The fact that you don't feel like you're forced to gamble in the Diamond Dynasty mode makes it more enjoyable then other games with similar modes.    If you're a sports fan and haven't tried MLB The Show then I highly recommend it.  There are modes for franchise (many seasons of using a team), single season, Road to The Show (where you create a player to go from the minors to the major leagues).  The franchise mode has an online capability which is awesome.  You can use real rosters or you can fantasy draft teams with the game's 55 released to date legends.  Finally, the graphic detail and the stadiums is stunning.  Beautiful recreations of all MLB ballparks and some older parks along with fictional minor league parks give the game a high quality aesthetic experience.10/10",alanj28

But how does Darkest Dungeon run on the Switch, and how does it compare to the other consoles?Before heading any further, it is worth a warning to those that have never played: Yes, the game can be difficult. And yes, you will likely a lose a lot of units. And, yes, it will not always be entirely your fault. RNG is a heavy factor in this game, and if you are not a fan of that, I wholeheartedly advise you to stay away from Darkest Dungeon. That being said, the game is fantastic, and the port was done very well.As I found with the other console versions, the controls aren't nearly as fluid as they are on PC. Buttons can sometimes be a little confusing and unintuitive, but it doesn't take too long to get used to them.Frame rate seems stable in both docked and undocked modes. My untrained eye can't perceive what FPS it's running at, but in a slow, turn-based game such as this, it doesn't particularly matter.The touchscreen is able to be used in portable mode which, while it's not required, felt more intuitive than the button controls. I particularly like that the touchscreen can be used for all menu, combat, and navigational purposes. It makes playing in portable mode a lot more fun than I would have expected. However, as with the Vita version, the Switch's screen suffers from a small UI. Text can be hard to read, and touchscreen may be harder to navigate for those with larger fingers.Perhaps the highlight of Darkest Dungeon on Switch is its battery life. While I have not tested it in all possible configurations, it lasted 5 hours and 12 minutes with maximum brightness and Wi-Fi enabled before hitting the 1% mark, at which point I put it into sleep mode to charge it.Darkest Dungeon at its core is a fantastic game, and its port to Switch is nothing short of well-done. Despite initially readjusting to button controls after heavy PC usage, I can fully see the Switch becoming my main way to play the game with its touchscreen options undocked and fantastic battery life.",TrainerEstew

Watch a high quality youtube video of it and you'll see for yourself how well the vibrant painting-like art style brings the game to life.  There is also a good dose of humor spread throughout the game. Trine 2 is a puzzle platformer with light RPG elements (you level up and choose what moves you want to unlock from a somewhat limited skill tree).  There are 3 playable characters and whether you're playing by yourself or with 2 other friends (local or Live) you can swap between the 3 at any time.  Each character has unique abilities and each is necessary to get through the levels.  If you legitimately try to solve the puzzles, they can be pretty difficult at times. However, most of the time you can simply exploit the wizards abilities to get across the gaps. This game is definitely at its best when played with friends, especially local.  With the uniqueness of the 3 playable characters everyone playing has to pull their weight, which often times leads to some pretty funny moments when someone messes up.  If you've played all the way through Trine 1 there really isn't a whole lot new with Trine 2, it's just a more refined product. Trine 2 is also a bit longer than I expected and did start to get somewhat dull in the later 1/3 of the game, until the great looking final boss.  It would have benefited greatly from having more bosses like the final boss.

The game hinders itself by making every little choice a micro transaction. They reduced how much virtual currency you earn in games significantly, and raised the cost of every attribute. Trying to play the game without spending $20 on virtual currency is impossible since they built it into the fundamentals of the game.Apart from this, they took away features from las year. You can't play MyCareer without having Xbox Live Gold, MyGM does not have the league expansion feature we had last year, And MyCareer's story is not only embarrassingly pathetic, but you cannot exit out of cut scenes, most of which are 3-10 minutes long (note: there are cut scenes before/after almost every game your rookie year). I couldn't possibly be more disappointed.Also, beware of the other reviews out there marking it a 10/10. Some are obviously paid reviews from people who don't speak English and don't actually play the game.Edit from original review:The game is still terribly flawed from microtransactions with little being done from 2K’s position to indicate that they care at all about user complaints.  The inability to skip the poorly-written storyline is another frustrating feature, however after your rookie year, most cut scenes seem to disappear.  However bad the storyline is in MyCareer, it's fantastic in comparison to MyGM's storyline that is embarrassingly bad.  (Spoiler: Your decisions don't matter because the boss and his son will do whatever they want anyway and overrule your decision).  MyGM, something I usually replay every year at least two or three times, is unplayable.MyLeague is by far the best and most complete mode.  The customizations for new teams and league option changes continue to solidify it as the best single mode of any sports game, period.  The AI for other GMs is pretty interesting and nothing out of this world has over-taken any team, as was a problem in previous iterations.",jay_caspian

It is especially grating with the GOG release considering that the Soundtrack of ""Planescape: Torment"" has been available for all owners of the game, ever since GOG relaunched seven years ago... up until now.Beamdog, the new publishers of ""Planescape: Torment"", have chosen to sell the Soundtrack for a price that used to cover both the Soundtrack and *the game itself*.To make matters worse, they've also removed the original edition of the game from the store and effectively doubled its price by bundling it together with the twice as expensive ""Enhanced Edition"".The end result? Customers now have to pay 30€ for what used to cost 10€, a prime example of despicably unethical price gouging.Sad since Planescape Torment is a timeless classic whose name will be now associated to a shady company who aims to milk established RPG franchises by adding mods and ugly UI targeting the android market while forgetting about its main audience.There was a real opportunity for Beamdog here to finally do something right by hiring Mr. Avellone to add the original cut content and develop some areas he clearly stated would like to expand on in several interviews, But God forbid, that would have cost Beamdog some money and this EE would not be the easy cash grab presented to us now.""What can change the nature of a man?""

I myself was actually worried going into this one after watching some game play, but it has definitely exceeded my expectations. The first few battles start off slow, but after I got to the third battle or so, and realize what they're going for, I was insanely immersed.The ambiance that's presented for each new enemy is very well done. There's a different theme and music score for basically every new foe you face. The slow pan down and narration when introducing each fight is some of the best presentation I've seen in a game for quite some time.  If you don't like visual novels, and a good amount of dialogue, this game might not be for you. However, these type of games aren't usually what I look for, either.The game is actually very challenging as well on hard mode. It always a good thing when you're getting worked up when the enemy completely crushes you. When I finally beat one of the fights I had been stuck on, there was a very awesome feeling of intense satisfaction... to me that's a sign of a great game. I don't know if i'll play this thing online against other players, but the ambiance presented in the story mode is EASILY worth the price tag. Also... the soundtrack, absolutely amazing.",abowman

If you have a strong focus on the negative when reviewing games then that is what you will find. Obviously there are visual glitches such as jagged lines and pop-in throughout the game. Glitches aside, I play on a 46"" Sony Bravia HDTV and this is a very good looking game in full HD. The lighting effects and the textures are particularly well done. Also, the story is interesting and the comic book style cut scenes are beautifully done. While traversing Empire City what struck me is how fluid and intuitive scaling the entire city is. Cole can climb the way I wished that Altair could in Assassin's Creed. One thing I love is that I can jump off a tall building and land on a powerline far below if I aim correctly. I also like the fact that Cole can engage in a shoot out no matter what his position is. You can be hanging from the ledge of a building and still shooting reapers down below. The fact is, if Sucker Punch had created a game that was entirely derived from market research then we would have the same crap we have seen repeatedly over this current console generation. while playing Infamous I feel that I am playing a game that was designed first and foremost to be fun to play. I know that Sucker Punch designed this game, just as the Sly Cooper franchise, from the ground up with a fun gameplay experience being the main objective. They have achieved this admirably. This game plain and simple is fun as hell to play. That in my book is the most important factor in gaming. A job well done for Sucker Punch. I look forward to playing any future titles they release as well.",JonsonL.

1155,Gone Home: Console Edition,PlayStation4,3,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        The absolute only reason this game was well received was because it has atmosphere, and centers around a lesbian relationship in a non exploitative way.My experience of playing this game was one of very high initial hopes, slowly fading into resignation to the fact that game wasn't going to do anything more than it had already presented. Purely from a presentation standpoint, there's every reason to think it might be great when you first start out. It's got great voice acting, and a very quiet tension like you're actually in this house and learning whatever it might have to tell you. Unfortunately all it has to tell you is that the daughter is a lesbian, the father is a failed writer, and the mother has the hots for some dude at work. That's it. That's the game.The developers of this game clearly thought that having the player walk through a house and figure out some girl was a lesbian was enough narrative to complete a story, but it isn't. It's relevant, and unusual, and of-the-times. But it's not the basis of a game worth playing, let alone one you would pay $20 for.If there's any silver lining here, it's that indie developers in the future might look to this game and gain some inspiration as to what can be done with a very minimalist environment and story-telling approach like this. I just hope those developers come up with an interesting story.",StophJS

The cars in the game feel realistic in terms of everything, and I was especially impressed with the handling of the cars. There is a decent selection of cars in the game and none of the cars feel like an afterthought because each car has had a lot of effort put into them. The amount of customisation you can do is simply stunning. You can literally change everything and tailor it to how you want it to feel when racing, which is awesome. The game has a decent amount of content for you to sink your teeth into, and I especially enjoyed the career mode. The career mode has a great depth to it and will keep you invested for hours, and the game offers you a number of tracks and places to race so things stay fresh throughout. The game unfortunately though can be very difficult at times and it doesn’t get much easier on the lowest setting, so casuals will find it difficult to get into the game. The presentation side of the game is stunning. Visually the game looks very realistic, and the amount of effort that’s gone into the weather effects is extraordinary. The sound design is also brilliant and the cars sound gorgeous throughout your time with the game. At the end of the day the developers have managed to improve most things over the first Project Cars. Project Cars 2 has taken what was good about the first game and improved them further, which makes this installment even more realistic. Fans of the first game will love this addition even more, and I can actually see them gaining more fans with this installment.

Designing your own course from scratch, managing the club`s economy, developing your avatar`s golf skills in practice rounds and even full competitions and managing the level of enjoyment of your guests and members is very addictive. Amazingly it takes ages for it to even start to become repetitive.I think my favorite part of the game though is the ranking system the game uses for your holes. Far from letting you build holes willy nilly, TGA requirements mean you have to build varied holes, both in length, par levels, bends and topography while also making them attractive. Make too many similar holes and your customers will get bored and quit; make too many easy holes and they will get bored and quit; make too many hard holes and they will become frustrated and quit. You also have employees weeding your greens and fairways, selling soda and food as well as service buildings of various kinds.

The game is very challenging but yet very rewarding. The main concept of the game is to find solutions to generate certain chemical compounds from material compounds. For this purpose you have several operation commands. You combine these commands on the board to achieve the purpose, which is to generate certain chemical compounds. Once in a while you really need to be very innovative to find solutions. In some puzzles just finding out the solution to produce target compounds is not enough. In this case you need to find solutions to produce the compounds efficient and fast enough to achieve the goal. You really need to think about many perspectives of operations. Efficiency is one thing. Another important thing is stoichiometry. There are 12 challenges which demand you to find solutions under restrictive conditions. This is a very nice idea since it encourages you to find better solutions. It took me about 200 hrs to beat this game including the challenges. For me this is a good indication that this game is hard since It took me about 100 hrs to beat Puzzle Dimension, another challenging game, to score over 50000. The price is cheap ($9.99).

Also worth saying this generation brought to the main series something I always loved in the mystery dungeons spin-offs: an exciting, beautiful story. While the first set of games focused more on Lillie and her relationship with her abusive mother, here this plot point still remains, but a new focus is given to the character of the legendary Necrozma, which really reminds me of characters from the previously mentioned mystery dungeon spin-offs, which is a very good thing. It's suffering and state as an endearing, understandable antagonist was really well written and a pleasure to see added in the pokemon games and mythos.",1_skydarktime

Accompanying the fantastic storyI absolutely loved The Stick of Truth and when The Fractured But Whole was announced to say I was excited would be a massive understatement. Thankfully the game pretty much delivers in all areas and in some ways it’s better than The Stick of Truth. The story in the game is once again fantastic and it had be giggling like a child on more than one occasion. Accompanying the fantastic story is some very good and enjoyable exploring. The map is incredibly fun to explore and the game allows you a lot of freedom when exploring, which makes things even better. You will without a doubt sink a great deal of hours into the game and thankfully it has lots of content that has a lot of variety going for it. There are quite a few improvements over The Stick of Truth, but the most significant improvement is definitely the combat. The combat in the game is awesome and they’ve done a wonderful job of making the combat both simple and strategic at the same time. There is also a lot more customisation in this game, which is great. You can literally change everything about your character and the customisation is almost endless, so you will have a lot of fun doing this. My only gripe with the game is that the puzzles are not challenging, which in turn makes them a little boring. The presentation side of the game is absolutely stunning. The visuals and sound design combine together perfectly and it amazed me how well they’ve made the South Park style become a game. At the end of the day South Park: The Fractured But Whole is without a doubt one of the best games I’ve played in quite a while. It has managed to take all that was good in the first game and somehow make it even better, and as far as sequels go it’s probably one of the best I’ve ever played. Fans of the first game will adore this because I was a fan of the first game and I adore this, and I can’t recommend this game enough.",Xbox_Alive

All of the basics are exactly what you would expect, but it takes a while to learn how to change classes, or logically pick a spawn point, or spawn a vehicle, etc. A simple legend would have saved me 20 minutes (the amount of time I played before realize that they weren't about to explain anything about they key in-game systems and I had better look them up).After watching a few of their videos I learned what some of the objectives were, although some things (like how to cloak) I never really found out. I'm not particularly inclined to. MMOFPS sounds fun but the problem is that battles are silly and one sided. You'll spend a bunch of time taking random bases on the front lines with no resistance, and you'll spend time trying frantically to defend a base from overwhelming resistance. How do 3 guys with rocket launchers stop 50 guys with tanks and engineers and invisible snipers? They don't.It's boring if you're on the team with 50 tanks. It's frustrating if you're on the team with 3 rocket launchers. After 30 minutes of watching tutorial videos and 3 hours of playing I can say with certainty that they need to rethink the MMOFPS concept before it will be able to create engaging gameplay. There are a lot of low points :airplanes can kill new players with impunity (new players literally have no way to kill aircraft until they unlock heat-seeking rockets by paying real world cash or playing for 10 or 20 hours), spawn points are often humorously far from any objectives you care about (2+ minutes), some of the worst graphical glitches I've had in a few years, and long waits for continent switches (you might need to wait 10 minutes to be allowed to spawn on a continent with enemies).Despite a lot of sloppy unpolished presentation, I'm not sure the concept itself is even valid. I had a little bit of fun running around doing 1v1 at some remote base or being involved in big team on team battles, but that action is few, far between, and still less compelling than any FPS I have played in this generation or any other.This is easily the most boring game I have played in a decade. If they ever make some basic ""quality of life"" concessions and find a way to create compelling combat in the MMO genre this might be worth another look, but as it stands I think the game is about as compelling as the Pinocchio game on Super Nintendo.",Pugilism

I decided to play Williams on Grass on ""Hard"" and the outcome was far closer - a 7-6(4) 6-3 victory after close to an hour of play. Top Spin 4's gameplay is intense and you really have to work for every single point which is very refreshing especially if you're a tennis game fanatic like myself.While Gameplay feels and looks amazing, the sound department definitely could have used a bit more work; audience reactions to points seem a bit premature, the umpires sound as static as in Top Spin 3 and the grunts are horribly mismatched to specific players. Some of the player chants (""come on"", ""yeah"") are so obviously dubbed and sound more like they are coming from someone giving commentary than from someone on the court.Something that would have been a nice addition to the Top Spin series that is obviously lacking in the fourth installment is the incorporation of the challenge system used on the real Pro Tennis Tour - something that features in Smash Court Tennis 3 and would have made gameplay even more exciting. I played many points where shots landed right on the line or seemed impossibly in and it would have been a nice touch if your opponent could challenge the calls.All this aside, Top Spin 4 can be described as a solid, well rounded tennis simulation game. Gameplay is fast, exciting and intense and this game is hands down the most realistic tennis game ever made. One can only hope that Virtua Tennis 4 and Grand Slam Tennis (from EA) will take notes from this game.",schwellie

The plot is interesting but much less engaging (and ultimately, surprising) than the original. I'd have been happier with an expansion pack that just smartened up the AI a little, improved the visuals, and left the interface alone.

The story is interesting (especially since it doesn't involve Reapers, Cerberus, or Collectors (I won't say more in order to avoid spoilers).  This doesn't just feel like a filler story, but is rather thought out.  Characters from previous games are brought back, and many background stories (such as the First Contact War) are given more context.  2) The second component of the DLC is similar to the Hearthfire expansion of Skyrim (although not as involved by any means).  This allows Shepard to obtain and customize an apartment on the Citadel.  Kind of a fun experience, and it allows for Admiral Anderson's background story to be more deeply investigated.3) The third component of the DLC revolves around the fact that it opens an entirely new district in the Citadel for exploration.  There are many things to do, but the most notable are the Casino, Video Arcade, and Combat Simulator.  The casino has a variety of games to play to gamble some of your in game credits.  The video arcade has a handful of simple games to play.  The combat simulator is one of the best additions in the DLC.  It resembles the Pinnacle Station DLC in this regard from the first game, but is much more customizable  it draws heavily from the multiplayer of the game.  This mode allows you to play with squad members from ME1 and ME2  which is awesome.4) While not a separate component, this DLC lets you interact with characters from other games throughout  fighting along side them and interacting with them.  Characters such as Miranda, Jack, and Thane, will allow for additional romance options (if you romanced them in ME2).  Final thoughts  this DLC is amazing.  The small story doesn't feel wasted.  The extra district in the Citadel is fun to explore (especially the combat simulator).  The apartment design is probably the least appealing part of this, and that is simply because it is so simplistic.  The interactions with your crew- both past and current are very well done.  Overall, the DLC is excellent.  The writing is also very good  and inserts a LOT of humor (which is a welcome relief to the sometimes tense mood of the game).  I would highly recommend it  and even though it is the most expensive DLC, it is by far worth the $15 asking price.",Nikola8
1239,Halo 5: Guardians,XboxOne,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        TL;DR Campaign 4/10 | Mutiplayer 7/10 - - Overall 5.5/10Review (Campaign) The Halo 5 Campaign had a very good start especially when 343i showed Hunt The Truth. The idea of having all of these intertwining problems (Civil War, Promethean Threat, the Return of the Flood, etc.) sped up the hype train very much. It was also cool to see 343i go back to the roots of Halo 2 by having a second main character in the campaign. Unfortunately at release, it all fell apart. The problems with Halo 5's campaign fall under two categories, the gameplay and the story, with the latter being the worse of the two.In Halo 5 Guardians, you have access to squad commands, this is where the person playing as Locke or Chief can command his AI allies to move to position, to attack a target, pick up a weapon, or to revive a fallen teammate. The problem with this though is that the AI do not respond to threats and only follow the specific orders. For example, if you get downed, you can call an ally to revive you. Most of the time, they won't sprint towards you and they won't avoid hostile fire. They're very slow and very very stupid but this can avoided if you do coop. Humans > AI always.There are a number of problems however with the story itself. The first is that the Master Chief is not a main character of Halo 5 Guardians. If we consider Locke and Chief as main characters, they should both have an equal amount of game time. Out of the 12 actual gameplay misssions (15 total but 3 are just walk around cutscenes for Osiris),  only a 4th of the game has Blue Team involved. I feel like 343i wanted to replace the Master Chief which is very hard to do. Bungie did a very good job at making the Arbiter a main character by giving him good dialogue, good background, and good story revolving around the covenant. Locke on the other hand is a very bland ONI agent that doesn't really get me to have any emotional attachment whatsoever.  Campaign is pretty short for a Halo game but it's really the reveal of the villain which sucks the most. A lot of people wanted the flood, mendicant bias, and/or insurrectionists in this Halo and all we get is more prometheans, this time with Cortana as their leader. Most people were tired of the cheesy love story between Chief and Cortana. To top it all off, they end the game in a cliffhanger that doesn't really get the feeling of a good (But annoying) cliffhanger like Halo 2 ""Sir, Finish this Fight."". In short, Characters are bland, the story is bland, and the cliffhanger is disappointing. I guess 343i is really related to Bungie (See Destiny).Final Score: 4/10Review (Multiplayer)Unlike the abysmall launch of Halo: Master Chief Collection, Halo 5: Guardians had a very solid launch with little to no server issues (EAST US). As a person who bought MCC day one, I felt that 343i didn't do a satisfactory job at fixing the game (With coop not even having a stable frame rate above 10). I was really concerned that the same may happen with Halo 5 but luckily I was wrong. With that being said, the game doesn't really innovate beyond Warzones which is the redeeming factor of the game.Almost all the spartan abilities (Thruster Packs, Ground Pound) were either already in the game or are just gimmicky and unnecessary. There is no real use for Ground Pound and for Spartan Charge whatsoever and yet people claim that these changes are innovative. It feels as if that 343i couldn't add in anything new to improve the game but tried to balance what features were already in Halo 4 (Thruster Pack [AA] and Sprint). Due to this, grenades are much more powerful and you die much faster than in other Halo which is disappointing. Despite these changes, Warzone is without a doubt the most innovative addition to the Halo franchise and I love it a lot.Warzone is a 12v12 game mode that pits 1 team vs 1 team vs neutral enemies. This forces players to not only kill the enemy team and secure bases, but to work with others at taking out AI enemies that spawn in. There is a problem with this which whoever gets the last hit takes all the points (Someone can snipe an enemy from a mile away and take all the points) but it is a really cool idea. I loved it the moment I saw the game mode at E3. If 343i can fix some of the balance issues in the game and make more warzone maps (Or even allow us to make them in forge), they've got a really good game ahead of them.Final Verdict 7/10Conclusion: Halo 5 is another divisive game just like Halo 4. There are the fanboys on Metacritic who give the game 9's and 10's blindly buying whatever 343i gives them and the haters who give this game a 0. I don't think either of them should be allowed to review games because Halo 5 needs criticism but not hatred. 343i is improving Halo but I do not believe that this is the game that will turn the franchise around after Halo 4/MCC. Hopefully they'll get it right next time with Halo 6. Good luck Spartans!Final Verdict 5.5/10 - Better luck next time!",llMasterBetall

Trine 2: Director's Cut offers puzzle-platforming action that is rendered significantly better by the sheer beauty of its scenery. Be it marching under the incredible light of the game's morning sun or sneakily jumping along rooftops on a medieval city's night, the visuals are nothing short of amazing, and are one of the best reasons to keep getting back to the game.The actual gameplay, however, ends up justifying the lack of a full-fledged retail version. This is not to say Trine 2 is a bad game; it still offers a good amount of decent ideas often implemented in fun ways. The further you delve into the game, however, the more things start to drag along.You play as a trio of heroes (a wizard, a knight, and a thief), each with their own abilities and expertise to help you solve puzzles. Things work well enough for the more action-based knight and thief characters, and their sections are often the most enjoyable. The wizard, however, requires annoying control mechanics to fully use his powers of telekinesis and conjuring objects out of thin air. That's a big shame, because those mechanics are by far the most interesting the game has to offer.Perhaps the adventure would get less boring over time with a slightly bigger number of much shorter stages. The ones on display here have a tendency to overstay their welcome, which often made me go load up other games rather than start battling my way through a newly-unlocked Trine 2 stage.Again, there is definitely enjoyment to be had here, especially thanks to the game's overall atmosphere of a mythical medieval quest. Levelling-up and unlockable new abilities are a nice touch, often prompting you to extend the play session just a bit more. Still, it's glaringly obvious that this game could have been much more than it is, if only its gameplay mechanics were half as jaw-dropping as its graphics.Rating: 6.0",ricklongo

The main attraction of this game is that it rewards you for doing any quest or completing anything noteworthy, and this makes you want to carry on with the game. The combat in the game is also something that makes the game stand out. They have managed to take the classic RPG turn based style and tweak it slightly to make the combat both exciting and interesting at the same time. The crafting mechanics in the game have a decent variety to them, and I enjoyed crafting the items and in my opinion it gave the game some more replay value. The story that accompanies the gameplay is very good and it manages to intrigue you throughout. The story also gives the characters a layer of depth to them and it definitely made me care about them more. I would however have liked the text to have been a bit bigger because I must admit that I struggled to read it at times and this did make me miss some important points. The presentation side of the game is simply stunning. The art style breaths life into the game and it definitely makes the game beautiful, which in turn makes it stand out. The music in the game is also brilliant and it delivers a number of different atmospheres for you to take part in. At the end of the day if you look past the technical issues then you will find a very competent and exciting RPG. The world is not as big as other games in the genre, but I don’t think it needs to be because the game has more than enough here to keep you satisfied. It gets a lot of the main things right and for me that’s more than enough for me to recommend that you give Battle Chasers: Nightwar a try.",Xbox_Alive

The characters are lovable and interesting and I found my self so into their stories and the story at large that I sometimes had to just put the controller down so I didn't rush through the game.Phew, I haven't even talked about game play yet. It is a standard old school JRPG and if I could get one complaint out of the way is that the random battles can sometimes get excessive. Other than that the gameplay uses a unique system where all the characters share a single action bar with different moves and attacks subtracting from that bar. Special attacks have some great visuals and it's satisfying finishing off a boss with them. I really could go on and on about this game. Go on Ebay and buy either the GC or DC version and play it, if you are even a remote fan of RPG/JRPGS you will not be disappointed",McGlone16

Most Wanted 2.0 also has many more cars and a more interesting variety, which is awesome. The take-down system from the Burnout games is well implemented and makes racing much more interesting. The streamlined menus are easily accessed from the D-Pad for swapping cars, parts, and managing events. However, Criterion's makeover falls short in a few disappointing ways for me, in no particular order:    1) No manual transmission!?!?! That was one of the few pieces of enjoyment I got from racing games, being able to downshift in anticipation of turns and having the added challenge keeps every race fresh; not in this game though.    2) No customization. Basically a cornerstone of NFS was the customization. You can't even pick the color you want it in this one... (aside from zipping through a drivethrough to repair and recolor it randomly). You unlock  part upgrades by getting 2nd or 1st in a race and there's basically 2 options per part and allow you to tweak the stats slightly and get a pro-version of that part for completing certain challenges. That's it. No performance dymo, no tuning, just plug and play.    3) No car progression. What I mean by this is you don't save up for that special car you've had your eye on and then make it your own in this game. (In fact there's no currency at all.) You get 5 events to do with each car and then its essentially done, and you move onto the next car and rinse and repeat. That was something I (and I think a lot of people) really enjoyed doing in NFS games was building your baby from the beginning. Sure you might go through 3 or 4 cars on a play-through but you always had that goal to go for. Without being able to progress a car like in NFS Underground 1 and 2 and Most Wanted 1.0 it really takes away from the game by making it too much like the Burnout's.    4) There is no consequence for getting Busted. As you may remember from NFS Most Wanted 1.0, if you go busted you had some options. Using the tokens you got from Blacklist members to get out of jail free or add impound strikes could save you from paying those hefty fines which increased the more mayhem you caused. In this, you go back to the police station. That's it. No money in the game for them to take away, no way to lose your car. Just go back three spaces. Really makes pursuits completely pointless by doing it this way. Just finish a race with cops on you? Just stop and save yourself 5 minutes of trying to evade, it doesn't make a difference if you evade or get caught; sad but true.    5) In NFS: MW 1.0 they had a plot for us for why we were trying to go back up the Blacklist and had some little plot twists and deception going on which was a nice touch. Here in 2.0, the nice lady voice tells you about the list and that you should be #1 and to have fun. I'm not sure what I would ask from Criterion in this department...but it just feels like they should have done...something.    *** IN SUMMARY, this doesn't feel like a NFS game as much it feels like a Burnout game and while the game does a lot of things right and it would play fine for a game on its own merits, this just doesn't live up to the original. If anything I just want to play the first one more now, but give it a go and try it for yourself. It's not a bad game by any means just not as good as it could have been by keeping the core and building around it, instead of trying to smash two franchises together in a somewhat disappointing way to both NFS and Burnout fans.",Praxiss
1269,Frozen Synapse Prime,PlayStationVita,8,"Frozen Synapse Prime’s gameplay solely bases itself on committing to a plan and watching it fold out. You set up your troop’s movements, actions or lack thereof and end your turn, also known as “Priming” your turn. The enemy AI/player then primes their turn and an outcome is shown. This is where you’ll see your troops kick ass and take names, or have their names taken, and you guessed it,Frozen Synapse Prime’s gameplay solely bases itself on committing to a plan and watching it fold out. You set up your troop’s movements, actions or lack thereof and end your turn, also known as “Priming” your turn. The enemy AI/player then primes their turn and an outcome is shown. This is where you’ll see your troops kick ass and take names, or have their names taken, and you guessed it, their asses kicked. If you make a mistake it can cost you one or all of your guys. The difficulty of Frozen Synapse Prime is unforgiving but fair, however I did notice that enemy AI tends to follow the same pattern every retry. You can study these patterns post-mission as whether you lost or won, can view a replay or the game seamlessly, allowing yourself to find where you messed up or the enemy got the upper hand. While enemy patterns can be understood in missions where you are protecting an area or escorting a VIP, in a straight up kill all enemies in the area type-mission, it can feel a little less dynamic.While games like X-COM: Enemy Unknown simplify the concept of turn based combat to area of effects, cover dependency and dice rolls, Frozen Synapse Prime offers a wide variety of actions each soldier can do. You can queue up multiple pathways with different actions, such as making your guy sweep by every room for enemies as he runs through a hall. You can save a guy who was about to return fire at a sniper by telling him to ignore any  enemies he sees, duck behind cover, wait for the sniper’s shot to miss and run to safety while the sniper takes the time he needs to line up the shot. It’s that level of control you can have over your soldiers that isn’t left to a dice roll like other turn based games that gives Frozen Synapse Prime its own feel of complete control over every situation.The game offers multiplayer and offline skirmish options that actually have a nice twist. To compare the infrastructure to another game, think the way mobile games offer the ability to come back to the game to take your turn. Frozen Synapse Prime has that feature, which is a thing I don’t think I’ve seen on the Vita before. It’s nice to be able to create a match, take your turn, and wait for an opponent to join and take their first one too. The game lets you know if you have any games waiting for your turn, allows you to find games, select quick match or just create a game and take your first turn in a randomly generated map with balanced squads of up to 4v4. When creating games, you can adjust things like map size, shape, whether or not enemy soldiers will have to be in line of sight of your soldiers to be visible to the player and turn limits. You can set how what soldiers your opponents will use, which hopefully everyone will be nice and mirror squads so everyone can be on the same page. With that in mind, each class is fairly balanced. Even putting a group of snipers up against a group of shotgunners will put both players at disadvantages.For aesthetics, Frozen Synapse Prime is a welcomed change in colour palette and visuals. The change from the dark, deep blue environments of Frozen Synapse on the PC to the stark white polished steel look of Frozen Synapse Prime is stunning, especially on a handheld. The framerate can get a little hitchy at times with things like explosions or panning across the map when multiple things are going on, but nothing that really draws from the experience. While the gameplay I’ve shot off of my camera might not do the game’s visuals justice, here are some screenshots I’ve taken, along with a gallery of screenshots I’ve included in the description of the video. The soundtrack to Frozen Synapse on the PC was stunning, and with the port to the Vita, Nervous_Testpilot’s work is still great to hear. I recommend picking up the soundtrack, whether in the bundle at a small discount or separately, there’s some seriously good stuff in there if you like anything electronic.Frozen Synapse Prime is a great example of how a remake is supposed to be done.",Paskill

The new modes and features (driver test, champion mode, localized weather..etc) are nice but they're only relevant for a short period of time.  Nothing much is new also in online multiplayer. Where F1 2012 truly shines is on the improvements Codemasters made to the core part of the game: Handling is much much better (F1 2010 was too strict, F1 2011 too lenient, this year we have the best of both world.. you need to nurse your car, mistakes can cost you big time and the car doesn't feel like it's on rails), engine sounds are fantastic, the game is now using more realistic lighting and the tracks are better detailed than before... you can see that in the demo, for instance at Monza. The AI is much smarter than in the previous games, much more competitive and doesn't back off as easily. It's also more respectful and careful not to make contact. For the first time in this franchise I'm enjoying some real wheel to wheel battles with AI drivers. On the downside, the penalty system is still very unfair and inaccurate, and you can't turn it off. Illegal overtakes give you a couple of seconds to give the position back and the ""legal"" borders of the tracks are better cut than last year... so it's still an improvement. Tyre wear doesn't scale anymore and engines blow up when you downshift too rapidly... some people consider these to be cons, but I think they improve the realism of the game. Overall, it's still the best F1 game out there and arguably one of the best racing games on consoles.

It's good that the add-on has a slightly different (and noticeably more difficult) feel than the core Dishonored games.  Billie Lurk's powers are sort of a trade-off situation.  The ability, for example, to wander around as a ghost and scout out areas is insanely powerful and feels almost like too much, until you realize her other limitations like a shorter leap ability and none of the traditional slow time/possession type abilities.  Her powers essentially make the game slightly different.  If, like me, you love playing the game as stealthy as possible (I absolutely loved going for the no alert/no kill playthroughs), this game is probably the hardest in the series yet, mostly because your options are more limited.  But not in a cheap way, moreso in that the level design is more realistically construction around parts of Karnaca that are more inhabited and not under bloodfly or plague restriction.  So there's a different feel to the levels.Where the game takes a sharp and strange diversion from the previous Dishonored games is in the ""Contracts"" found in each level.  Dishonored always had minor side-goals in levels (some were obvious, others had to be discovered, and there is *some* of that here in DotO as well), but they were always integrated into the setting and storyline of the level.  Here, though, the Contracts, while an interesting way to spend more time doing more things in levels, are often extremely difficult while also putting you in situations were a full-stealth playthrough is virtually impossible and seem not related to the story.   Also, a few contract involve killing people which, in some circumstances, can only be done directly, so you will lose your no-kill score if you complete them.  Why would BIllie, who is trying to accomplish all her goals as quietly as possible, bother murdering someone in plain sight for some money?  Thematically, it doesn't quite fit into the game as well as the other goals did in previous games.  But, they are optional of course, and ultimately the core game is easily worth the $30 for Dishonored fans who want one last visit to this incredibly realized world.  As with Dishonored 2, there are occasionally AI hiccups in NPCs and little glitches here and there, but nothing that kills the game.All of this said, if you have never played a Dishonored game, I'm not sure I would recommend this.  To begin with, the story requires you to have at least some familiarity with the stories of DIshonored 1 and 2, but the difficulty is at a level designed for people already basically familiar with the structure and style of the game, so newer players would be kind of dropped in the very deep end when starting this.  Experienced fans, though, you really should check it out.",StanleyPain

It's usually fine, but when this requires a specific tactic, which is usually just a pain in the butt and less effective than even a basic zerge. You will literally wonder why it was put in, as it literally makes the fight tedious.No ability to spin the camera that I can find.Controls don't seem optimized for consoles.Other than that it is quite an enjoyable game.

The fun to Just Cause 2 is how open it is and what all it provides for you to do. Yes, if you focus solely on collecting the stupid collectables, you will get bored (it does get pretty boring) but you don't have to do that, nor do you have to focus solely on the missions. The main point to Just Cause 2 is to ""cause chaos,"" a seemingly cliche way to tell the player to do whatever the heck they want to blow stuff up and have fun to progress to further missions. I've played over 150 hours and still found new, fun things to mess around with, the most recent being grappling a truck to a helicopter and swinging it around to the speed that it starts swinging my helicopter around. Basically, it comes down to this: If you're into games that push you (the player) to make decisions about how you want to play the game and to make the game fun and unique to you (whether you fast travel everywhere, drive and take in the gorgeous sights, or hijack helicopters and fly everywhere), you will enjoy this game. If you enjoy open world exploration and the freedom to try crazy ridiculous stuff, you'll enjoy this game.However, if you're looking for a strict, linear, engaging story telling experience, you probably won't enjoy this game. If you're looking for a realistic portrayal of physics and gunplay, you probably won't enjoy this game.Personally, I find the game's story to be absurd and insane -- which I feel is the point. I think they wanted to focus more on the content and free-roaming nature and I feel they did a very good job of that and it got me on board with the crazy storyline. The voice acting adds to this ridiculousness, it's almost that they don't want you to take the story seriously, and so that's how I approached it. My personal opinion is the negative reviews this game is receiving are because players are expecting the game to tell them or show them explicitly new and fun things to do, where Just Cause 2 pushes for creativity. Yeah, you could simply walk up to that radio tower and shoot it and be done, but what if you hijacked the helicopter over there, grappled a car to it and used the car as a wrecking ball to smash the tower? Then when your plan falls apart and you accidentally crash the helicopter into the tower instead, you can hop in the car and drive off. You, as the player, have to have some vision in order to see all the potential and fun there is in the game. There's things to collect and upgrade, there's things to destroy, there's semblance of progress, and there is an immense amount of fun all in Just Cause 2, you just have to be open to playing around and trying ridiculous things.",NorthKozar

There's a lot of content for you to get to grips with and fans of the series will no doubt be satisfied for a long time to come. I really enjoyed the improvements that have been made in this year’s game because both the racing and handling feel more tight and stable this time around. The career mode is without a doubt the best the series has delivered so far and I was very impressed with the level of detail that’s been included in this mode. This game is accessible to all gamers because the assist and difficulty options means gamers of all skill levels can enjoy the game.I enjoyed the online components of the game more this year because they’ve catered to my needs much more this time around.The media interactions are a nice little touch there just isn’t enough variety in them so they do end up becoming quite repetetive and tedious after a short while. Does F1 2018 do enough to get a recommendation from me? Last year’s F1 game was without a doubt my favourite game of the series so far and I was hoping that F1 2018 would build on the momentum that was built from F1 2017, and thankfully I’m pleased to say that this year’s game has built on the momentum and then some. In fact F1 2018 is now probably my most favourite game of the series so far and that’s mainly because its made improvements again. The career mode is absolutely fantastic and it has a depth to it that we’ve never experienced before. You’ll be pleased to know then that the racing that accompanies the career mode and every other mode feels better than ever and this does make the racing feel even more rewarding. As far as problems go the game doesn’t really have any and when it’s all said and done if you’re looking for an F1 game that gets as close to the real thing as can be then I thoroughly recommend that you make a purchase of F1 2018.",Xbox_Alive

And although I thought there were some inadequacies in the gameplay, the story it told was wonderful.As to the gameplay, as with many games of this genre, you walk around, have limited ability to interact with the world, and don't have many options. Where that genre becomes weak though, is when there aren't many options and the player can't figure any of them out. So the player spends some amount of time achieving absolutely nothing. That might be atmospheric at first, but then it becomes boring. So great care must be taken in the design so that there is an appropriate level of game, but players don't drop off because they can't proceed.Unthinking boofheads who just like to kill things in games are not the target market for this game, and should avoid it.

Hearing the characters scream with dialogue from the movies and game makes you want to keep putting in more quarters start a new game each time you run out of balls.Each table has multiple missions to complete, and hidden areas that make standard tables inferior. I would love to see a real life table this complex.The BadMy only complaint, and this has been the case since the game was ported to the One, is that there is only one achievement per table, and each of the achievements are not something a beginner could do. I hope that for future tables they go back to 3 achievements per table, with varying degrees of difficulty.The AchievementsWith only one achievement per table, it may take players some time to unlock all three, as they require complex tasks, and require you to know your ramps and table locations.In the Aliens table, you must play on mission 3, Ulterior Motives, and defeat both Facehuggers. Luckily, you can enable mission select for the table, so as soon as you hit the mission marker you can select mission 3. Unfortunately, you only get one shot at it, and if you lose a ball, you will need to start the game over in order to select mission 3 again.The AvP table requires you to rank up. I wasn't able to unlock it during my playthroughs for my review, but it is probably the easiest of the 3. The final achievement is for performing 20 stealth takedowns on the Alien Isolation table, and I'm not sure what is required for this.I played each table for around an hour a piece, but wasn't able to unlock any achievements. With some practice, and maybe a guide, I can probably unlock them at a later pointFinal VerdictOther than the achievement complaint, these are solid tables for anyone that enjoys pinball, and especially for fans of the Alien franchise. I recommend this DLC and at $9.99, it is standard pricing for similar table packs. I look forward to the next high quality DLC from Zen Studios.",AchieveAddicts

The game follows Aurora's quest to get back to her duke father in Austria, while exploring the world, collecting items, gathering allies, and defeating dark beasts. It's the usual RPG fare fans of the genre are accustomed to, except from a sidescrolling perspective. The battle system is a fresh take on turn-based combat, incorporating elements of real-time strategy. It all works great, in no small part thanks to the breathtaking watercolor graphics and superb background music.The story is a heart-warming coming-of-age tale, in which Aurora uncovers the mystery of her unexpected trip. It's well-crafted and filled with interesting characters. Fittingly for the game's overall mood, it's all told in the form of a big poem, with rhyming sentences. It's a great idea that is considerably held back by the bad quality of the overall writing, with more than a few awkward rhyming structures. The content is still appealing, but the form ends up sadly muddied.Perhaps Child of Light's greatest triumph is its tightness. At around 15 hours, the game does away with much of the fluff that plagues some RPG titles, leaving only the strictly necessary for a memorable journey through a fantasy world. There's an extensive but easy to understand skill tree for each character as they level up, while actual equipment items give way to a simple yet deep gemstone-crafting system. It's true that the world of Lemuria could well support a more extensive quest, but the game is still a refreshing experience that can make a lasting impression (and comes for the budget price of $15, it's good to note).Child of Light is proof that an AAA company like Ubisoft can deliver titles on a smaller scale and fill them with indie charm. More impressively, it's an arguably superior game than pretty much every recent offering by the company. If you're a fan of RPGs, or if you simply enjoy gorgeous sceneries to look at while embarking on a fantastic adventure, this is a must-have.Rating: 9.0",ricklongo

The game has two different difficulties, normal for people who want to play the game in its normal difficult format, and casual for people if they find normal too difficult and unforgiving.The game is packed full of content, plenty of hours worth of play time with the story, side-quest missions, exploring, hunting enemies for supplies and anything else to collect and see everything it has to offer. Once you have completed everything in the game, you can even scan QR codes given out by Altus to get even MORE side-quest missions to play. You can also share guild cards via QR codes with other guilds (and if your level is high enough, you can hire members from other guilds to join yours and help out but they can't gain experience or have their equipment or skills changed). There is even a New Game  where you can replay the story again will all of your characters and their equipment remaining in the next playthrough, however, all of the items that aren't equipped  to characters (that are in the inventory or storage) are deleted.Although many people find this game to be rather difficult, I tend to disagree, I had my entire party at level 70 by the time I reached the 3rd floor of the 3rd main dungeon when playing on normal difficulty, but I will admit that the bosses in the post-story can be extremely difficult and unforgiving if you aren't properly prepared. The last two secret bosses in particular can even take down a party of level 99s pretty easily if you don't have a good plan or strategy in place.Overall, its a great RPG dungeon crawling game, but it can consist of a lot of grinding, strategic planning and fighting difficult battles to complete fully, if you aren't put off by that, then I suggest that you check it out.",Luigibarqs

The hero units were really implemented and the entire game is so startling different that I'm amazed at the number of people who haven't heard of it.  It was a rough year for Big Huge Games, as I expect they had trouble presenting it as any sort of ""sequel"" to Rise of Nations.  Take one look at the box for the original PC release and you'll see the problem, ""Rise Of Nations: Rise of Legends.""  Why on earth they featured this bizarre half-attempt at connecting it to their novice first title I still don't know.  It doomed the game effectively, as I'm sure many who bought it were not clear how different the game was structured compared to the ridiculously popular ""Rise of Nations"" and ""Rise of Nations: Patriots and thrones.""  The three factions in the game are all beautifully designed, though equally similar in terms of how they play.  Their are only two resources now, which works out just perfectly for a such a fast paced real time strategy game of this kind.  This is a game where matches can last just twenty minutes, so I'm sure the change-up from the lengthy Rise of Nations confused many new players.  The Cuotl, the Vinci, and the Alin are all so enormously realized, that many should give it kudos for taking something entirely new and fresh for once.  The combat system is much tighter this time around, the hero abilities and powers are the chief focus in most battles, which takes a lot of heat off the player constantly activating unit abilities alongside.  Yet, what happened?  The game had everything to offer to new players and still fell short.  Who knows really.  It was a bad year for Big Huge Games, but its been many great years since of falling in love with this wonderful world they've created set apart from the scourge of their beginnings.  If you haven't played this game, you really aren't a fan of RTS games I'm afraid.  It still has so much to offer and though lacking in a solid single player campaign, the skirmish mode is incredibly fun and their is no doubt in my mind- you will have a great time with this game should you play it.",llamayarmybar

The main story is interesting and there are A LOT of secondary missions. This was something that I think everyone already knew.What I try to say is that we have to look further. Xenoblade X provides a giant world to explore. And I mean GIANT. Even the city (New Los Angeles) is enormous. We have no loading screens while we're in open world, where there are SO MANY THINGS on screen. And the framerate keeps stable. Yes. The framerate is freaking damn stable. And that's one of the best things in this game, as the Wii U is not as powerful as other systems, and Monolith have Managed to take all this stuff into a 25GB disc and make it run on the Wii U perfectly. Genius.On the other hand, you're not just going to kill stuff and leveling up. You will need to help the mankind in order to survive in planet Mira, and that means you can choose what you do in every moment. And there are many ways of helping people, as defending the city from the creatures outside, or being a mediator between some people's relationships, for example.I can only say this game is, no doubt, one of the best games I've ever play. Totally worth it.",Steinhaal

Although the actual game-play graphics are rather poor, the CGI animations during cut scenes is so high-quality that there are even a couple of small moments when I mistake them for real actors. The plot is incredible, and is not just another cheap war game where you work your way into the enemy and hit their capital and wipe them out. The whole complication with the Gray Men of Belka made it really interesting, especially with the 8492nd Squadron and Captain Hamilton. Like the previous game in the series, Shattered Skies (A.K.A. Distant Thunder in Europe), it does not take the war lightly. For example, in the mission where you escort the Kestrel and other ships out of Port Hewlett, there is a brief cut scene in the middle, which is appropriate seeing as this is the first mission that you fight planes that aren't unmanned aerial drones, in which the news reporter narrates seeing living people drowning in the ocean after shooting down the Yuktobanian planes, and becomes emotional and begins saying ""Just stop this! I can't take it anymore!"" This game amazes me even further with the new addition of commands to your wingmen. The action your wingmen take can really change the course of the battle, because they do not go off and clear out enemies if you have them following you in cover-mode the whole battle.",The1stGodfather

Without a doubt this game has given this particular genre a new lease of life and the best thing is that theEven though I’m a big fan of dungeon crawlers I feel like the genre is a little on the stale side and I think that’s mainly down to there not being anything really new included in recent times. This however has all changed thanks to the newly released dungeon crawler Moonlighter. Without a doubt this game has given this particular genre a new lease of life and the best thing is that the new unique elements work extremely well throughout your time with the game. The biggest pulling point for me with this game is its shopkeeping elements and this is what gives Moonlighter its unique edge. Thankfully this particular element is fantastic and it gives the game a lot of replayability, but you will have to get used to how the shopkeeping formula works because there isn’t much of an explanation available to you. Thankfully though this isn’t a massive problem and everything else in the game is simple to grasp. One aspect of the game that is particularly easy to understand is the combat, and this in turn makes the combat remain fun and interesting throughout your playthrough. The combat is further enhanced thanks to the fantastic enemies you come across. Each enemy has a huge amount of variety present in them and to say I enjoyed taking on the brilliant bosses would be a massive understatement. In fact I would go as far to say that the bosses that are present in this game are some of the best bosses I’ve ever faced, which is a very impressive feat. Another impressive thing about the game is the amount of content the game has. In terms of content the game has more than enough to keep you satisfied and the best thing is that the content has a great deal of variety dotted throughout, which in turn keeps things fresh and interesting for quite a while. I don’t really have many gripes with this game and the only thing I would’ve really liked included in the game is a little bit of a story because I think a story would’ve made the game even more of an enjoyable experience. The presentation side of the game though makes you forgot about the lack of a story and that’s mainly down to each aspect being done really well. Whilst the sound design is more than good enough the true beauty of this game is found in the visuals and the charm that comes from these visuals is huge, which is great. At the end of the day Moonlighter has made me realise why I love dungeon crawlers so much because it’s taken everything I like from this specific genre and improved it whilst at the same time adding its own unique features. Without a doubt this game gets a huge recommendation from me and if you’re a fan of these types of games then this game is a must buy.",Xbox_Alive

Luckily, it was the former. The art style of the game emulates a classic Super Nintendo RPG, and the drawn art that's thrown in is extremely nice. Hero 30 is a pretty decent RPG without the face-paced thinking that goes into each and every level; trying to think of some way to cut down on just a little more time. EvilLord 30 and Princess 30 are humorous takes on RTS (albeit, simple RTS) and Shoot 'um Up genre respectively. Each story has its own plot with serious elements to it, but none of them ever get too serious. This game is running on a ridiculous concept and it knows it. The characters and their dialogue (specifically the Time Goddess) have such odd personalities for the roles they play. Each level has a decent level of ability to replay, either to get a better score or to collect something that was missed the first time through. The music is catchy, and as you rarely hear over thirty seconds of any track, they tend not to get old. This game is a must-have for anyone with a PSP.",Ryan

1359,Minecraft: PlayStation Vita Edition,PlayStationVita,9,"I love Minecraft. I've been playing since early alpha, and even though I don't play that much Mincraft anymore, I was still very excited to hear there was a Vita version coming up.And even though it took them more than a year for it to be released, it's finally here.Make no mistake, this is not a port of the Pocket Edition version for Android and iOS. This is the full PS3/360I love Minecraft. I've been playing since early alpha, and even though I don't play that much Mincraft anymore, I was still very excited to hear there was a Vita version coming up.And even though it took them more than a year for it to be released, it's finally here.Make no mistake, this is not a port of the Pocket Edition version for Android and iOS. This is the full PS3/360 experience. Which is awesome, because frankly, the Pocket Edition just isn't complete enough for me to enjoy it. And even though it has unlimited worlds, the Vita version is more feature complete.Sadly, the only thing holding it back slightly are the worlds. The worlds in this version are small. Not as small as early Pocket Edition, but still not too big.This is because of Sony policies (and probably Microsofts too) about save file size. This is a big restriction and I think that Sony needs to reevaluate these policies so that we might see slightly bigger worlds.Luckily, they're still big enough for you to have enough space to build and explore.Another negative that I have to bring up are the graphics. While I love how Minecraft looks, there are some problems with this port in particular.For one: The draw distance is really short, even compared to the PS3 version.And two: The framerate tends to dip from time to time. It's not that bad, and when you're just busy building and mining, you probably won't notice it, but it's still something that has to be brought up.Let's hope that 4jStudio can improve these some more in a patch.But still, even though these last things were negative, it's good from here on.It's the full console experience on my favorite handheld. There is so much to do, you can build, you can hunt, you can craft and almost everything in between. It's so nice to just pick this game up while you're on the train or the bus, play for a couple of minutes. Or when you're on vacation and you need your Minecraft fix.And you can even bring your save files from the PS3 with you. That's right, the game features cross-save.  This allows you to transfer your worlds from the PS3 to the Vita, and backwards. Sadly this is only semi-compatible with the PS4 version. You can transfer your worlds to the PS4 version, but you can't receive worlds, due to the bigger world size.A great thing about the cross-save feature that I never see mentioned anywhere, is that it allows you to download worlds from the internet, put the saves on the PS3, and than transfer these saves to your Vita. So now you can bring things like that cool recreation of the Kanto region you saw online, or a Sky Block survival map with you on the go.This is by far my favorite version of Minecraft. It's not the best by any means, but having Minecraft on the go with physical controls and tons of features just totally kicks ass. And the best things is that new content is on it's way. Like horses, witches, bats and many other things.I recommend this game to everybody that likes Minecraft, or exploration and building games in general.",PizzaSlapper

I can somehow forgive it's 'shortness' because of the immaculate graphics and generally insane detail put in. Playing such a visually stimulating game in HD on a large screen, is something to behold. Although it seems a lot of the reviews are concentrating on the fact that it is a short game, current trends in DLC and extra, post-release content will no doubt expand the game again, for a small fee of course.

The game’s aesthetic is more reminiscent of the latter, while the gameplay is heavily reminiscent of the former.A highly difficult platforming game, you play as Ash, a black blob with one good eye. He can run, jump, swim, and do a sort of butt slam attack into the ground that accelerates his rate of downward motion and can smash through breakable ground. He can also hang off of ledges and do a longer horizontal jump while doing so that will also smash through breakable sections of wall.The game starts with Ash playing a nigh-impossible retro-platforming game. Given the great difficulty, the player is very likely to die… and the moment they do so, the game glitches out and breaks, and Ash goes out into the world to make a new friend now that his video game cartridge is busted. The world is a post-apocalyptic hellscape, rendered in the style of a place full of tumors and black blobby enemies and spikes.You can’t kill enemies in this game; indeed, contact with any black blob enemy will instantly kill you. There are some enemies – signified by having white skulls – that you can jump on the heads of to propel yourself up into the air. The game is mostly about environmental challenges, though, and avoiding the enemies – springs, spikes, collapsing buildings, and similar challenges are the barrier between you and getting to the next screen. There are sections of the game where you swim around, including in boiling water that will kill you within a few seconds, so you have to get out of it quickly.The game’s mechanics are on the whole simple and relatively straightforward. Your challenge on every screen is to make it out onto the next screen; there are optional challenges, in the form of both harder-to-reach tumors sitting around in mostly-obvious spots in the levels, where the challenge is to get to them, and secret side areas, which are hidden off of the main path and which contain mega-tumors (5 tumors) or game cartridges at the ends of them. These paths are much harder than the main path, and the paths which conceal later game cartridges are amongst the most difficult parts of the game.The game cartridges are an alternative collectable that allows you to play a “retro” style game, pixel graphics, where you must navigate through levels which are even harder than the main game. These, too, award you with tumors for completing them. Unlike the main game, many of these also have limited lives, meaning you only can fail 20 times before you are kicked out and have to start over on the minigame (and you must fail fewer than 10 times to get a bonus tumor).While the main portion of the first half of the game does not have limited lives, in the second half of the game, the player’s tumors become extra lives, refreshed every time the player reaches a checkpoint – once every 20 levels or so. Because the second half of the game is much harder, this greatly encourages the player to collect those tumors, and the final level of the game subtracts a whopping 450 tumors from your total (out of only about 500 or so in the whole game), making the final section of the game much more difficult to complete without getting kicked back to the start of the area.Unfortunately, this game feels like a less good version of Super Meat Boy – but ironically, not directly in terms of gameplay. Ash plays differently from Meat Boy, but he works well and the levels are, on the whole, interesting to complete.The biggest problem is the level select and the collectables. The levels are almost all linear, but you can only go to the first of 20 levels in an area, and then push your way back through all the others in that area if you want to collect a missed collectable. This strongly encourages the player to collect every collectable on the first time through an area, or else forces them to tediously re-complete the area while searching for them.The other problem is that the game has very little in the way of a sense of progression. There’s only a handful of cut scenes, rather than the one after every section of levels that you saw in Super Meat Boy, and beating one area just leads onto another, harder area, rather than any sense of reward. This gives the game a feeling of monotony; what are you accomplishing here? Nothing, really. And the second half is even worse because there is no clear goal – you just go out and do platforming sections. While this doesn’t seem like it should matter, it somehow does, and it diminishes the game as an experience having no real sense of progress or a meaningful goal.Not being as good as Super Meat Boy doesn’t make it bad, and indeed, I had fun with it overall. But this is definitely not a game for everyone.",TitaniumDragon

This is one of the most ambitious and one of the most, if not the best installment of the franchise. The visuals are superb; the shading, the lighting effects are just wonderful. The cinematic scenes, although not the best this year, are up to par with the gameplay graphics unlike with the previous installments. The game is quite lengthy too. The main campaign gives you tons of hours and even when you're done with it, you have a handful of side missions to complete. There are three different approaches; Ghost, Panther and Assault which add an amount of replay value. The plot is also great, featuring one of the most interesting and most diabolical villains in the history of this franchise. The voice acting in general is good. Although Eric Johnson never succeeds over Michael Ironside when comes to portraying Sam as he is supposed to be, he does manage to give us a depiction of a fearless leader and skilled tactician. Ubisoft also brought back the group dynamic atmosphere back from Chaos Theory. We have a better insight on Sam's new relationship with Grim, his best friend Vic, his daughter Sarah and his former nemesis Kobin. Briggs, the new character, serves as the rookie who often makes mistakes while Charlie serves as the group clown. The only major flaw I must point is the difficulty. The game's rookie, normal and realistic difficulty settings hold your hands up until the end. The perfectionist, although offers more challenge than the previous still doesn't bring back the challenge we in the legacy games.Overall, Blacklist is that kind of game that manages to please both; the fans and the gamers who play it for the first time. It's a definitely must buy.9.8/10.",Munich

I picked that game up and immediately threw 50 hours of my time at it, loving every second. This not only met all my expectations but exceeded them.Presentation/Graphics:The presentationFinished this seconds ago after over 70 hours, beating the game on War (Hard) difficulty for the first time.I had high hopes for this game, SMT IV being possibly my favourite RPG of all time. I picked that game up and immediately threw 50 hours of my time at it, loving every second. This not only met all my expectations but exceeded them.Presentation/Graphics:The presentation is basically identical to SMT IV, as are the graphics. However, worth noting is the improved artwork quality. SMT IV had some really awesome demon designs, but many of them were busy and clashed with pre-existing demons. This has been resolved with some re-drawn demons that look fabulous, as well as several new ones which are welcome additions to the roster. Character art all seems spot-on too, retaining that SMT IV awkward charm (think Walter's **** eating grin).Story:As for the story, it's probably the only thing that will prove subjective. SMT IV had such a heavy atmosphere because of the situation you were put in, wandering into a vast, unknown landscape with little support. This is not that, and not SMT IV, but what it is fits this game's story well and is done interestingly. You have a real party of individuals from different walks of life, and while it's a bit close to a typical RPG party, I enjoyed all of the characters involved (even if you seem to learn very little about one of them). A prominent theme in the story is banding together and avoiding easy outs to bad situations, and I think the party suits this well. I liked the story, and I think the true ending here is more satisfying than that of SMT IV.Gameplay:The combat is just bliss. Every little problem in SMT IV was re-evaluated and changed into a valuable system here. This is a monumental accomplishment, as partners, smirks, status effects and other elements now all feel genuinely impactful, making for an incredibly deep and satisfying combat system. Once you get good at it, the game is also very good at letting you handle repetitive tasks with ease, simply because it knows they are bound to happen eventually. It just nails everything, and I deeply hope that SMT V takes this system and runs with it. Demon Fusion is just as good as ever, and with the skill +/- modifiers on demon skills, choices are even more important. The boss fights for me on War were tense and difficult on many occasions, while still feeling fair. The true final boss in particular was an amazing experience; a heart-pounder the likes of which I hadn't experienced since P3:FES.By the way, the map is quite similar to the original, but unlike in SMT IV I never found myself struggling to find a path.If I had to list negatives, I'd be scrounging for them. Grinding might be necessary occasionally, though demon fusion is almost always a better solution. The only real issue I noticed was how difficult it was to generate money throughout the game. It can be important, and there are points where enemies will flat-out steal large chunks from you so be wary.By most people's rationale, this game shouldn't exist. There's better ways to make money than this, certainly. This is a passion project from the devs of SMT IV, setting out to do something almost nobody does: refine a flawed but great game into a spectacular one. Please, if you're even giving thought to buying this, just do it and play it through ASAP. It'll be worth your time, and it's worth supporting good devs.",globogim

The AI leaves every other history title’s AI I’ve played in the dust.UGG excels at providing details such as portraits of the brigade and battery commanders.Players always know precisely how many men are serving in each unit and the status of the men.The game has a wonderfully detailed and accurate map of Gettysburg that is visually stunning.Game scale allows players to control large armies at the brigade-level that are visually satisfying.Infantry units move over the map in columns, for speed, or in lines, for battle.Command and control concepts are easy to understand.Orders are easy to issue with troops moving along drag and drop paths.It is great to see a design team taking on historical titles with the intent to make games that replicate historical battles.The acceptable:Game speed is fixed – which requires all players to play at the same speed.  This can be a challenge for new players as they learn to identify unit status, organize responses, and react in RTS time scale.  Most players get over the learning curve quickly and genuinely enjoy playing UGG at the selected game speed.Historically the rock walls at Gettysburg played a key tactical role in the battle (the Angle or the Slaughter Pen are examples).  In UGG the map includes features such as rock walls on the map; but, there is no value for the “cover” these positions provided for the troops.  As a result players tend to move their defenses to areas of higher “cover” that primarily include forested areas, particularly those at the crest of hills.  It doesn't impact the game play – but it does shift historically relevant landmarks.Could be improved:There are a number of implementation choices made by the design team to ensure outcomes that meet the goals of the design team.  For example, the 2 Union cavalry brigades that opened the battle of Gettysburg are broken into 5 units to ensure the CSA does not sweep the field before Union infantry arrives in the morning of July 1.  Victory Point locations also impact the flow of the battle to ensure players play according to the historical script.  For example, Herr’s Ridge is an important location for the CSA to hold in Phase 1 & 2.There are also design team perspectives on “what makes a good game” that take precedence over historical reality (so I’d argue the game is more RTS/Arcade than battlefield simulator).  For example, the design team favors cavalry – so cavalry plays a vastly more important combat role highlighted by the effectiveness of cavalry charging.  The cavalry implementation is not in line with the role cavalry actually played at Gettysburg or during the ACW.Artillery is anachronistically too powerful – so the speed of artillery batteries is significantly reduced to prevent artillery “Panzer” formation attacks.  While slowing artillery down achieves the desired result the unintended consequence is that the game drags a bit while the artillery glacially moves forward to provide support for maneuvers.Bottom Line:This is one of the best historical titles ever released!The AI is heads and antlers above anything that previously existed in the game world (IMO!).The game is challenging and the historical divergence tends to be small enough that even a historian can sink their teeth into the UGG experience and get a deeper understanding of the battle.I’m looking forward to other historical titles from the very talented UGG design team.For $10 there is no better bargain for a game that provides hours of entertainment.",Stonecold637

Fact is, it really is a badLooking for a great present for someone this holiday season? Well look elsewhere because NHL13 is a complete waste of $60 and whatever it costs to fix anything that you broke because you were infuriated by this awful game. Now, I know what you're thinking, ""Is this really a bad game or is this guy just exaggerating because he got mad at it once or twice?"" Fact is, it really is a bad game--a terrible game, and I'll tell you why. Every year EA Sports spares every expense to make a new hockey game. Each game has a gimmick, something slightly different from the last version that makes it ""better"". This year's gimmick was a more realistic skating engine that was intended to simulate real skating physics. I bring this up because this was the ONLY improvement from last year. Now, what makes this game bad after EA took a big step in the right direction with a realistic skating engine, is the all new luck factor that EA put in the game. The luck factor insures that the team that plays worse will have a much greater chance of winning than the good team. For example, the team that tries to set up great plays will always be stopped by the goalie, that is if the defensemen don't stand them up on their way into the zone. On the other hand, the bad team walks past the computer defensemen and takes a bad shot that magically goes in. I can't tell you how many times my team has lost a game because the other team walked around our defense and scored on a shot that their goalie saved only minutes ago, or because they scored on a floater from the blue line. Also, the hitting is like something taken out of Batman when Batman hits Bane with all his might and doesn't even scratch him, while Bane sends him flying with the flick of the wrist. Constantly in this game I've gone full speed (my speed is 90 by the way) at a guy and didn't even knock the puck away when I hit him, and then he brushes past me and my guy literally flies up in the air and lands on his head. I could go on and on for hours about how bad this game is, but for the sake your wallet and the safety of anyone around you while you might play NHL13, just trust me when I say to avoid this at all costs.",TheMarker_1

It is, in my opinion, the best ARPG I have played.About me: I have played and beaten every ARPG known to man since Diablo. Diablo 2 was my favorite of the genre, and I spent the next decade+ searching for a game that would evoke even more fun and joy while playing. I played all the mainstream games, all the indie games, and even some foreign titles in languages I could not understand in the hopes of finding a game with satisfying combat, interesting loot, great atmosphere, and amazing build diversity. I even ended up playing a bunch of short Flash based ARPG's in my darkest hours of desperation. I've beta-tested plenty of games, and even impacted a few. I haven't reviewed a game since Torchlight 2 (I regret giving it a 10, it's more like an 8 in comparison to Grim Dawn, as it's itemization lacked flavor and it's diversity was shallower than I realized) So Grim dawn is the first game I'll be reviewing in 2.5 years, as it has earned it.When I stumbled upon Grim Dawn I was intrigued, especially when I saw it's lead designer, Arthur Bruno, was also a leader in the development of Titan Quest (which fell short in a lot of ways but was the closest I had gotten, I loved the variety of items in that game and the dual class system). As I read up on him, and his posts, it occurred to me that he was the most articulate and intelligent mind I've ever come across when it came to designing ARPG's, and what made them so fun, and so difficult to get right. I originally pirated a version of the beta (build 13), then caved and bought early access around build 17. Each build was so significantly better than the last that I was floored by how such a small team could make such efficient progress. Slowly and slowly the feeling got better until around B21 when I realized it happened: I felt the drug-like Diablo 2 cravings become satiated for the first time in over a decade. Needless to say, they've made a fan of me. As for the review:Let's go over the basics:Music: 9 - Atmospheric, moody, grim. Fits the theme of the game, and at no times is tiresome. I only wish they had more songs in their soundtrack.Sound: 8 - Usually satisfying and fitting, but there are some spells and attacks that get annoying to hear. Forgivable as we all have our opinions, and they're a small team.General Combat: 10 - Meaty, corpses flying, enemies flinching and wailing as they die. Tons of variety and ways to make your foes cease to exist.Gameplay: 10 - Will go into this belowFun: 10 - DittoI cannot summarize why I love Grim Dawn, as I love so many parts of it, but before I try to consider that this is a game originally made by like 2 full time employees and a few part-timers (eventually expanded to a full-time team of 10 people). It was kick-started by people who saw the potential of what Titan Quest could have been, and who were tired of Diablo-Clones failing to live up to the originals. Medierra (lead designer) and his team have on all accounts succeeded.An hack and slash that actually has a combat system with depth. It is a game with someone to offer every ARPG player. Whether you want to be a summoner, a massive area of effect spell caster, a dual wielder, a tank, a supporter, a ranged dps, or any combo of the above, you can do so in Grim Dawn... with style!Every skill in the game feels distinct in it's flavor, and with a devotion tree reminiscent of Path of Exile, yet very different, and items that can enhance an insane variety of your combat abilities, let alone grant you new skills and procs that you could build around. The higher difficulties you unlock are challenging but fair, and instead of just having a damned stat-wall (a numerical value your character must reach in it's stats before being able to reasonably progress) as many ARPG's opt for, Grim Dawn actual has some mechanical difficulty in it's fights, especially bosses. You will do best once you learn their abilities and how to play around them.The game is addictive to say the least. If there was anything it had that might put players off, it would be that there is so much going on in the combat formulas and stats available, that it might overwhelm less experience players.Do NOT let this stop you from trying this title. The best thing you can do to learn what means what, is jump in and experiment, and the players on the forum are more than happy to explain features and stats to you. Get past level 30 (out of 85) and you will see the game open up unlike any other you've played previously, and truly start to understand the scope of build customization available.My name is also adoomgod on steam, please feel free to add me to ask questions about GD, ARPG's in general, or for help building your character(s).

I wanted to wait until I finished this game before posting my review, but I thought I'll comment on what I've completed and learned so far, then I'll try to comment again once I've completed the game.  First, I have to correct something that Gameplayer03 said (no disrespect intended).  Gameplayer03 said that you can only play this game in 3rd person.  This isn't true.  I found out by accident that you can play it in 1st person too.  All you have to do is press up on the D-pad.  This will allow you to switch to 1st person.  Press again, and you're back in 3rd person mode.  Secondly, I will agree that the controls can  be very ackward at 1st.  However, just like Dalck said, if you put in an hour or two, the controls become easier.  Now that doesn't mean that Nintendo shouldn't have allowed usage of the 3ds circle pad pro.  Aside from resident evil revelations, I thought that I would get to use the second circle pad, but unfornately, no.  The only reasons I can think of why Nintendo didn't include this option, was due to the game being so far along in development, that if they went back and added, it would have delayed the release for quite a while, or, they would've had to cut some stuff to make it work.  Whatever the case may be, I hope that at E3, one of these gaming journalist ask why it wasn't included.  Anyways, I'm on chapter 11 now.  I probably could've beaten the game already, or close to beating it, but I've been having so much fun with the betting system.  For example, I've replayed a few chapters 4 or 5 times in the hopes of obtaining better weapons.  Also, I love the fusing system.  I just tried the multiplayer last night.  I did the team battles.  So far, it's cool.  What I really love about it, is that whatever weapons and powers you win, you can use in the single player mode too.  Now, about the story.  So far, so good.  Especially chapter 9.  I will admit at times,  that the constant chatter can be a little distracting, but only a little.  All in all, from what I've played thus far, I'm loving this game.  Will your hand be a little sore after playing this game?  Yes!  Will you find the stand helpful?  I didn't.  It kinda got in my way.  Will there be times you curse the controls?  Yes!  But, those times have been far and few (so far).  Truthful, once I completed whatever task I was having difficulty with, I forgot about the controls.  So, I hope what I've said helps.  If you haven't, I would recommend picking this game up.  In my opinion (so far), I would give this a 9.  Would love to give it a 10, but I'm taking off a point for the controls.  Also, don't know how metacritic tallies their score, but they have Gameshark review listed as 42%.  They gave the game a C-.  Don't know about you, but I've never known a C- to equal 42%.  In fact, a C letter grade is in the 70 percentile.  Just saying.  Before I forget, best buy has this game on sell for $29.99 (03/25-03/31).  If you haven't picked it up yet, go get it.  C-ya!",KoolC

However, when you start to examine Anno 2070 as an in-depth game, it is not a long lasting treat. Unlike most of the user reviews for this game, I come in new to the series. I was excited to hear that it was a blend of city building and real-time strategy. I was disappointed to find out that, while it does blend the two genres, it falls short of being rich in either side of content. As far as a city builder, it is spectacular in it's detail. I cannot say enough about the graphics, as it is the only reason why I played so long. However, as I got further into the game, I realized how limited I was to the types of buildings I could create, especially according to range. You are limited to how you would like to structure the city by how close you construct hospitals, casinos, trade depots, etc. The problem with this is that it leads to a lack of free expression in creating a city, having to structure around the peripheral buildings. This leads to a feeling that the entire game is linear in nature - there are not a lot of options to how you can plan a city. This is not helped by the campaign, which does not allow you to deviate from the orders set forth. It is basically just following instructions. While useful to learn the ins and outs of the game, it felt as if it were a tutorial rather than a story.In terms of strategy, Anno also failed to capture my interest. There are two factions - the Tycoon and Eco factions. Although dissimilar in nature, the idea remained the same; collect resources, build ships, fight when necessary. The deviation of what needs to be done is almost non-existent - the game is structured in a way that there is only a right way and wrong way of doing things. This hurts the replay value of the game, as well as the general strategy. Both factions have the same warships, and the lack of variety leads to hoarding and mass-manufacturing being the sole keys to defeating the enemy.In summary, Anno plays well as a resource gathering game. Looking for it to appeal to other styles of gaming, it falls well short.",jcmjesusx

Forgotton Anne though is one of them rare games that manages to do both aspects extremely well and in the end it delivered in almost all areas, which is great. Without a doubt the best thing about this game is its story. The story hooks you in straight away and it never lets you go throughout your time with the game because it stirs up a number of different emotions and you become attached to the characters quite a lot. Speaking about the characters each different one is interesting and unique, and the best thing is that they make the world that’s present in the game come alive in all areas. Another thing that makes the world come alive is the choices you have to make in the game. Each choice you have to make feels very important and by making each choice matter you become even more invested in the story and what’s taking place on the screen. In terms of the gameplay there are quite a few mechanics in play at the same time and for the most part they hold up really well. You would think that they would focus more on the story than the gameplay, but that’s not the case here because they’ve put an equal amount of effort in both and by doing this it makes the gameplay both challenging and rewarding at the same time. Whilst the gameplay is very good for the most part it does have a couple of niggling problems present from time to time. The main niggling problem is that the controls that have been implemented don’t always feel responsive and precise and this can cause you a few problems every now and then especially when you’re involved in some platforming events. You will also get a frustrated with a few puzzles in the game because some of them do overstay their welcome a little bit. I was however able to look past this because most of the puzzles are intersting and have quite a bit of variety going for them. One of my favourite things about this game was without a doubt the presentation. Visually the hand-drawn art style is packed full of charm and when you combine this with the excellent sound design and voice acting you end up becoming even more immersed in the game’s fantastic story. At the end of the day I can’t recommend Forgotton Anne enough. It’s managed to combine a number of different elements together extremely well and when these elements are in full flow you end up having an adventure that stays with you long after you’ve completed the game.",Xbox_Alive

The tower defense elements are fun for all the reasons tower defense games are fun. The action elements are both fun and extremely useful. Orcs Must Die successfully makes you enjoy using both of these aspects of the gameplay and balancing the level design and difficulty so that it would be difficult to win without making use of both.

However, this all is far more than just made up for with amazing series continuity (despite the inherent time-paradox of the premise) and, all simplification aside, great character writing, as well as addictive game-play. This might just be the first Persona Game where not a single dungeon ended up boring me and where I actually enjoyed listening to the dungeon music.

1451,Mega Man 9,Wii,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This game is possibly the best in the series. Actually, it is the best in the series. The plot is that Mega Man's creator, Dr. Light, is framed and put in prison. Mega Man has to defeat the defective Robot Masters and clear his creator's name. But, [huge surprise here, do not continue if your heart can't take it] Dr. Wily is behind it. The controls are spot-on. Mega Man feels just like he should, with perfect running speed and jumping mechanics. The one problem is the removal of 2 key features: The charge shot (which is made up for with the weapons) and the slide. The removal of the slide affects mobility negatively. The Robot Masters are well-designed and have very fun levels. The weapons you get are even better. Every weapon has a use at some point, whether it is for mobility or attack. The Wily Level bosses are all well done and fun to fight, and never get too difficult to the point it's not fun. Over all, I recommend Mega Man 9 to every gamer with a Wii, 360 or PS3.",roddor

It is very realistic and fun. There are many game modes. Some i still haven't touched because i have been playing the other game modes. First of all there is your everyday exhibition game. The gameplay works well with very few glitches. There were a few instances where there was some slow down but this does not happen a lot so it is not a major problem. The season mode is pretty self explanatory. You're a team that goes through a season or two. The weird thing, and i didn't notice this until halfway through the season, the other teams will accept any trade offer unless you turn the setting off. Overall this mode works well and this is probably where you will spend the most time. Then there is the my player mode. You create a player to try to make an NBA team. This is all good in theory but there are some major setbacks. You can call for one pass and it will bring down your game grade for excessive pass calling.

These improvements come in the form of powerful and more varied enemies; the inclusion of ""effigies"" that you can destroy that produce certain buffs on enemies, or summon firestorms that hurt you if you get to close; and the intricate and complex level design we saw (and personally loved) from the last DLC gets to be the center of attention this time around, with the central area being a huge hollow tower, with an almost labyrinthical structure, full of shortcuts, enemies and gorgeous views.As the previous DLC, this one comes packed with 3 bosses, with a clear emphasis in 1v1 encounters like we saw in the Artorias of the Abyss DLC for Dark Souls 1 (Artorias like boss fights) instead of the barrage of enemies thrown at you in previous bosses that made deaths feel cheap or unfair.These type of fights offer a much less frustrating game experience, while retaining the challenge we love from the series.",Tommapar

I love seeing the game constantly improve on itself.But that said, Summerset isn't an improvement. It's a step back. Where Morrowind blew me out of the water with its immersive experience, dynamic and highly rewarding quests, and fresh setting, Summerset was just, well, more vanilla content.None of the side quests were lengthy, dynamic, and rewarding like essentially joining the morag tong was. ESO is playing it safe, and tried nothing new with Summerset. It was rumoured they would introduce necromancy, which they could have easily done in addition to the psijic order - but why work harder than they need to?Everything about it just felt like a missed opportunity to me. Nothing in the entire expansion wowed me and the rewards to the player in skills, items, and cosmetics were all incredibly underwhelming. And perhaps they thought this was acceptable because they introduced crafting among other things, but... Really? That could've been for free in the base game.Finally one of the worst elements towards this hugely poorly created expansion was the boring, grinding way in which you advance through the Psijic order. It's so boring that the skills to me are not even worth the effort of mindlessly droning about Tamriel closing rifts.In conclusion, I'm nothing short of shocked that they thought it was an acceptable or exciting release and even more shocked that they thought it was acceptable to charge the same price as Morrowind on what felt like a step back from Morrowind, rather than the step forward I was hoping for.",Lecrivain

As just said, ONLY if you're ready to get you're ass kicked and get laughed at. (The game actually laughs at you every time you die)",AlexR

For people, like myself, who only got into the series recently with Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, you will be lost for a vast majority of the game. I was very disappointed that a brand new cast joinedYakuza 6 enters the west at a very weird time. The series is finally picking up steam here in NA but this is the final game in the storyline for Kazuma Kiryu, the main character since the first one. For people, like myself, who only got into the series recently with Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, you will be lost for a vast majority of the game. I was very disappointed that a brand new cast joined Kiryu in his final game in the series. There's hardly mention of series favorites like Majima or other characters of the like. The story also ends on a very meh note. While it certainly picks up towards the end, the story as a whole wasn't as good previous games. Not even Beat Takeshi himself could keep this story from just being average at best.That's all a shame as this is the first game in the series to update the main overworld and the stuff in it. From that aspect, it's great. Kamurocho has never been prettier and it's actually fun to walk around town and find new stuff to get into. However, the substories here are prob the worst of the series from the games I've played. There's not as much of the craziness that these games are known for here in this one as compared to the past. The side stuff you can do ranges from a very well done baseball sim to a clan fighting creator that kinda missed the mark. I just wished that the game that took the Yakuza series into the new generation of consoles, (because this game techincally came out in '16) would have done more with Kiryu's final story then what ended up happening. Especially since it was just starting to gain popularity in the west. While Kiwami 2 will keep Kiryu in the spot light, it almost would have been better for the series to have started from scratch with Yakuza 7, especially in the west. As it stands, the Yakuza series should be very well off going forward into the future. This is just a bad game for people who are only familiar with the 0 and Kiwami games to play. Because there's a ton that people are missing by not playing the 4 games from Kiwami to this one. For those who have been with the series since the original dubbed version on PS2, congrats. To the other 95% of westerns playing this game, it's a big realization that we missed out on a great series for years because it was mainly intended for Japanese audiences.",Kenmei

1513,Clubhouse Games,DS,7," Great variety of games, good bargain. There are some downsides, though. For one thing, there are a lot of kids' card games, which we adults probably won't play much. For another thing, the game is pretty weak overall for single-player use. The AI is a pushover in games like chess and checkers, and not much better in backgammon; don't expect much of a challenge.

The environments are pretty cool, and the levels are well designed. The story is also quite compelling. This is definitely the best of the series, and like I said before, this is my new favorite FPS. Bottom line: BUY THIS GAME.Update: I am much farther in the campaign now, and it's still pretty good. Another bonus is that the campaign is quite long, longer than I expected.

You can buy up to four themed areas separately or at once for a discounted price. If you're a fan of Pushmo then buying the whole package is a no-brainer. Stretchmo is played almost identically toStretchmo is free when you first download it. You get to play through a handful of tutorial puzzles that actually don't do a good job of showing what's in store when you purchase the full game. You can buy up to four themed areas separately or at once for a discounted price. If you're a fan of Pushmo then buying the whole package is a no-brainer. Stretchmo is played almost identically to how you would expect it to, but there's one twist that makes all the difference. Instead of just pushing and pulling back and forth from an initially 2D puzzle, you can now push and pull from the sides of blocks as well. Also, puzzles can now begin as 3D models which add even more welcome complexity to the previously established formula. I must say that this is a fantastic way to reinvigorate the series. I can't wait to see what the next game has up its sleeve.I don't know how they managed to do it, but Stretchmo is even cuter than other games in the series. As you traverse the park, various robots that represent each area show you the ropes. They each have their own personality as they teach you the tricks of the trade and get into all sorts of trouble. As a grown man, it's odd to say but I can't believe how adorable they are. I would even buy toys of them if Nintendo sold them. As with the other games, puzzles look sharp and you can freely rotate and zoom the camera to assist you with your plan for success. That being said, jumping around corners and in tight spots can still be a frustrating experience, but you can rewind time if you mess up. The included music is composed of the lighthearted orchestral flair that you're used to while sound effects offer even more frivolity to the equation. Overall, how can anyone not fall in love with something so uniquely charming on every level?As you work your way through puzzles, you'll unlock a ton of content that you can use to create and share your own puzzles in Stretchmo Studio. In the three non-Mallo areas, the puzzles are broken up into sections of ten. You can advance to the next section after completing five puzzles, but if you beat all ten then you get stickers that you can decorate your own creations with. Also, simply experiencing a new mechanic will unlock it in the level editor. Therefore, after playing for a while, you'll eventually be able to create 3D puzzles and apply mechanics such as manholes, pullout switches, and enemy spawn spots. If you're artistic enough, you can even apply Nintendo-themed stickers to the side of your puzzle to create classic game scenes. When you're done, you can share it with the world by a QR code. Maybe I'll get to play one of your inventive creations soon! I'm looking forward to it.",Crappy

This top down, squad shooter boasts casual eviscerations, sonic booms of a stratagems entering the field.  bullets, rockets, and lasers flying off in all directions as you mercilessly pound the tech heavy cyborgs, Alien Bugs, and the Illuminate, a race of squid people! A grin of pure glee plastered my face as barrage after barrage tore chunks of viscera off my enemies and teammates alike. Can it match the excitement of riding around in a cocaine fueled truck, travelling at high speeds through the amazon underbrush? Maybe not, but that’s not how you live forever, and it gets pretty close at times.The game opens up with a cheerful exposition, describing your aim and purpose in the Galaxy spanning adventure. You are a HELLDIVER, an elite soldier made to bring freedom (read: Death) to the already pretty free alien species that you meet. To do so you will have access to powerful firearms and assorted goodies, called Stratagems, courtesy of SUPER EARTH, your home.Your mission? To protect the assets of the Galaxy and push back the alien, and human, scum back on three fronts. If you are successful in pushing them all the way back to their home planet, you will confront the supreme leader of the races, where victory means one step closer to annihilating the alien scourge for good, until, that is, the global campaign resets, and the deadly dance begins all over again.The missions themselves are a randomly generated affair, which gives the game a nice bit on longevity, although they can start to feel a bit repetitive after awhile. I’ve only put about fifteen hours into the game, but I’m already starting to feel the grind. I’m in no way exhausted by it, but it does start to feel a bit samey. Luckily the combat itself is particularly meaty, with pieces of your targets casually flying off as you aim centre to them, a game mechanic whereby weapon shots can actually bounce of the target, doing no damage. So make sure to keep your weapons laser sights centred  on enemies and away from friendlies, as friendly fire is always on. The ability to call down Walkers, airstrikes, and gun toting APC’s, lends the game a tactical approach, with players often bringing down ammo for each other, or bringing in support drones that can either heal players, or kill enemies.It has to be said that the sound design is superb, with rifles and lasers all given appropriate weight and bass to them. The machinegun turret and starting assault rifle sound particularly meaty, with all other sounds produced at a wonderful quality that softly soothed my ears as Ishredded my enemies.Graphics wise, there’s nothing much to complain about, aside from a bit of lackluster AA that leaves the HELLDIVERS looking a bit ragged at times. All weapons and armours, and there are a huge bunch, ranging from what I think are Fallout homage laser rifles, to large anti tank rocket launchers, and also the occasional cheeky Dreadnought, are wonderfully done is a cartoony style that reminds me of LEGO figures and weapons, only slightly more edgy and polished.There are a few complaints, sometimes the game will randomly disconnect, and the host migration often meant that I was kicked out of the game entirely, although the game compensates by saving your XP and progress. However, this is juxtaposed by the absolute rush I got from playing this game. Time after time I was booted from a game, kicked for some less than friendly fire, and just general rage quits, but I always came back and raring to go because of the mix of great squad play and general awesomeness: The weapons, the fighting, the amazing cloth psychics of HELLDIVERS brought me back in.So in conclusion I heartily recommend this game. See you all in Hell.9/10The ObsolElitistReviewing old **** because I’m poor.",theobsolelitist

If combat was the only aspect of this game, it would be an easy 10/10.Unfortunately, combat is not the only aspect of this game. It is chock-full of platforming sequences that are simply not fun. A lot of them have timers that are horridly strict and punish you for even a slight mis-step. The controls are also just not built for platforming. Lastly, the enemies themselves also frustrate matters since one hit in the air causes you to recoil until you hit the ground...sometimes setting you back 2-5 minutes only to have it happen again and again.I know that this game is not meant to hold your hand, but I'm guessing that it is meant to be fun. The platforming sequences are just not fun. They are tedious.The music is awesome. The combat is awesome. The controls are kind of spotty but good most of the time (and not built for platforming). The platforming sequences are not awesome, and hold this game back something fierce. The highest I can give this game is a 6/10, and I count myself as a metroidvania fan.A bit of advice: Get a controller for this game and you will enjoy it much more.",Uhrmacher

With new tricks added to grinding, ramps, and bumpers, it adds a new layer of precision to objects that used to fling you around where you had no input while you were flying by.This game is better, stronger, and faster than the first Sonic Advance.  It leads the game to feel more epic and thrilling, and the running boss fights are an excellent addition, but also quite challenging.Probably the only thing that has always bugged me was how difficult finding the special rings are.  It's particularly difficult as you will likely fly past one without realizing, and you must make a certain path to each one.  Some are intuitive to find, but others are so far off the beaten path.  I've spent hours in a zone searching, and that's just not fun.  Still, the extra boss is great and was worth the torment.Overall, this game builds upon the first and makes it much better.  On the other hand, must won't see the whole game through because of how difficult finding those special rings are.",rhaynes7

1564,Crimson Skies,PC,9," I remember picking this up at the time of release. It deserved every poor review it got when it hit the shelves.

Nothing like it on the PC at the time, or since really. Not a typical flight sim, but an inventive, exceedingly fun atmospheric I remember picking this up at the time of release. It deserved every poor review it got when it hit the shelves. It truly was an unplayable mess, due to MS rushing Zipper to get it finished & out the door. (typical behavior for them) After patching though... WOW. Nothing like it on the PC at the time, or since really. Not a typical flight sim, but an inventive, exceedingly fun atmospheric alternate-history arcade flying game. Unlike most other PC flying and racing games, Crimson Skies had a story thrown in. This is usually the cornball out-of-place sort of thing you find on consoles (Midnight Club for example), and it could have really dragged the game down. Thankfully it was well done, fit the theme perfectly and actually made the game better than it would have otherwise been. In addition to the engaging story mode, there are a considerable number of fully customizeable instant action missions. In these, you can choose your plane, number of wingmen and their planes, number of enemies, their planes and pilot expertise, weapon loadouts and the environment in which the mission takes place. There's also an online component, which is free, as any proper game should be. It's fun, but there are only a handful of die-hard people still playing these days. Graphics were fantastic at the time, and are still nice today due to crisp high resolutions. Smoke effects in particular are nice, and flying through clouds still hasn't been done better visually. The planes are interestingly designed and have moving control surfaces. One cool touch: when your plane has taken enough damage from enemy fire that it is about to explode, your pilot opens the canopy, climbs out onto the wing and jumps off with a parachute. Many of the environments are much more detailed than your run-of-the-mill flight sim, with various buildings and structures to fly around/through. It's fun to simply fly around, low to the ground, checking out all the cool destructible stuff, which can include automobiles driving around city streets. The textures, water textures in particular, don't hold up well compared to today's games of course. The terrain is slightly more angular/low-poly as well. However, looking at what was available on consoles at the time, and even a few years afterward, the visuals and details were downright amazing. The sound is masterfully done, with authentic sounding 40's era music, professional voice acting and perfect sound effects. Control with a proper joystick is excellent. This is one of the best games ever released for the PC. Once patched, it's really difficult to imagine how it could have been improved upon. My only lament is that the sequel isn't available on PC.",MikeM.

You're not playing with a party of adventurers so much as a group of strangers silently hanging out together. In a game that gets half of its merit from story alone, this is a bit of a failure. The characters by themselves are fairly interesting with decent stories to them, but that just makes the lack of connection all the more frustrating.However, If you're looking for old school JRPG, that's what you're getting. But beware, there have been A LOT of ""quality of life"" upgrades RPGs have gained over the years that this game deliberately leaves out, to be more like the older games. Fights are very repetitive, menus are needlessly complex, the story is slow, and you're going to have to grind A LOT. If you're looking for all of that, which is what us older folks knew growing up, you'll be pleased. If you're a youngin' whipper snapper, this probably isn't the game for you. As an adult that grew up on these games with relatively little free time now, I'm torn. I want to like this, but I don't want to devote my life to it and the failing of the story to unite these individually interesting characters really ruins the momentum I had to play it.

So perhaps my perspective is different from the typical one you might find amongst user reviews.My first impression of the game is that it all seems quite overwhelming.  My onlyThis is the first NBA 2k I've ever owned and the first ""modern"" NBA game that I have actually played for more than a few minutes (my previous experience is with the 16bit era Live series, and classic NBA Jam).  So perhaps my perspective is different from the typical one you might find amongst user reviews.My first impression of the game is that it all seems quite overwhelming.  My only comparison for a modern sports game is FIFA 13, since its the only other one I own.  While both have a learning curve, I find that NBA2k15 is completely merciless to newcomers.  There are ways to practice, but they are buried within menus.  There is no proper tutorial mode, there aren't even really any tool tips to help you learn anything.  FIFA has numerous drills that teach you important skills, and it loaded them before each match to give you a random warm up.    NBA 2k15 assumes that you already know everything there is to know about basketball and the 2k series.  Thankfully, its not impossible to figure out, and watching a bunch of Youtubers play will get you the basics.I've mostly focused my attention to MyCareer.  My impression of it so far?  It is thoroughly entertaining, but it feels very limited in many ways.  It tries to be very narrative, which is nice, but the lack of resources means it doesn't feel as if anything could happen as well.  There are certain events that are supposed to happen, and by gum, they are going to happen, generally.   You also don't really have much in the way of voice choices.  In a world where games like Saints Row have way more character dialog, it is really disappointing to only have two similar voices to choose from.For overall game play, it seems solid enough, but I have little to compare it to.  I think the worst thing about the game are the canned animations, which can create huge problems in control, since people get stuck doing certain things and can't be interrupted it seems.   I am also not a fan of the shot meter and being hot or cold.  I feel like sometimes the game, via dice roll (or RNG, if you prefer), simply decides that I am going to miss easy shots.  I've missed open shots that were extremely close to the line on the meter tons of times, even though I've nailed the same shots many times before and after.  Passing is also very weird, and the AI has some weird ideas for what an acceptable pass looks like.There is a bunch of stuff I haven't tried yet.  I've tried to play online via the MyPark mode but the lag seems pretty noticeable, which is bad for a game where you have to actually time your button presses.  There didn't seem to be a way to warm up once in the park, so the only way to get adjusted to the delay is to join a game and ruin other people's team.  I suppose you could try to play head to head via exhibition, but I feel like the lag there wouldn't be the same since that is only 2 players, instead of a park filled with people.   The other modes, MyTeam, MyGM, etc, I haven't tried, so I won't comment.The graphics are nice, but facial animations during cut scenes are terrible, and people have robot hands a lot of the time.  My biggest pet peeve is that referees and other players can cover your shot meter, making it very difficult to shoot if you rely on it.The sound is fine, but I wish the game supported custom soundtracks.  A friend of mine edited his NHL 14 to have a bunch of custom tracks, so I am not sure why 2k15 doesn't have this simple technology.  GTA San Andreas even had it back on the PC.  SimCity 4 had it 10 years ago!I give it a 7/10 because it is a solid basketball game, but there is a ton they could do to make it untouchable.

All of these are due to EA's attempt to make the gameplay more wide-open. Essentially all they did was make the AI defense absolutely retarded.

This game is great, the gameplay is solid, plane selection is good(mainly just for looks, besides looks the only real difference is maneuverability), and the mission design is excellent, but the music is really what blows you away while playing this game, some real classics. The story is a standard arcade setup, you're in charge of killing bad guys, not really anything else. It makes up for it with some seriously good mission design, even games today could learn a lot about variety and layout from AC2, it constantly throws in out of the box ideas that live to this day. The one thing that really hasn't aged well is the movement of planes, it can sometimes be hard to tell exactly how you're angled in comparison to buildings and the ground, but for the most part it isn't an issue. The game is about 4-5 hours to beat, with 21 missions in all, some taking 2 minutes to beat and some taking 12. The plane physics can feel a bit odd, they have some basic gravity physics,but sometimes the movement of the plane can feel a bit odd and not being able to move the camera really detriments the game.

You can talk to Vendrick in the the crypt but he doesn't say too much, and I believe he is only there for the people who will buy all 3 DLCs..You can now buy an item that was in the DLC from Melentia, she will restock this item and only carry 3 of them on her at a time, until you warp out of the area and then warp back, she will sell more of them at a higher price...The enemies in the DLC were cool in my opinion but they have very high poise but are easy to backstab or parry.I gave the original game a perfect score when it came out, but after playing it again and again I realized that it was not a perfect score and didn't live up to  the first game.The DLC is better designed than the rest of the game but it's too short and probably should of been sold with all 3 DLCs in 1 pack.There is no reason to buy this DLC immediately you my as well wait until all of them come out.I really hope when all of them come out that it is on par with AotA but that will be very hard to do..",Makaveli

Thankfully it never felt too hard, but were a decent challenge near the end.As you play each song, you earn coins to spend on little trinkets.  So when you find that song you really enjoy, you can spend coins to just buy the music with in game coins!  Listen to your favorite songs as much as you like.You can also play locally with a friend through wireless play.  It's even more enjoyable when playing with friends.  You can do this to earn a different kind of currency to buy more songs to play with.  You can also do it solo if you want.In short, if you really enjoy rhythm games then I suggest getting this game.  The colorful characters and great music make a wonderful combination.  I love this game!",WaffleFox
1635,Duskers,PC,8,"One of the year's best indie releases, Duskers blends Paradroid (google it) with the static cam feeds from Aliens before making you control it all with keyboard commands.

To do this you must use,One of the year's best indie releases, Duskers blends Paradroid (google it) with the static cam feeds from Aliens before making you control it all with keyboard commands. It also avoids narrating anything, which sets you up for claustrophobic exploration of derelict space ship after derelict space ship as you attempt to piece together what's going on by yourself. To do this you must use, arm and upgrade drones. You start with just three, but more can be salvaged as you go.Aliens are almost all either dangerous or terrifying, and are really best avoided altogether, unless you have some sort of plan for how to kill them. Fortunately there is a robust array of drone upgrades that makes this a little easier. You can use Stealth to sneak up close to an alien so you can shoot it with Turret. Or you can Scan rooms from a distance, activate stationary onboard turrets and open doors to funnel scanned aliens towards them. Or you can simply open an airlock to flush aliens into space. Make one mistake though and you're dead. It's very nerve-wracking. There are also Mines, Interfaces for logging onto ship computers, Gather modifications for scavenging ships and Generator mods, needed to access power grids so you can open doors. Not everything is immediately useful, and experimentation is recommended with new mods.In addition to the aliens there are also many environmental threats. Radiation from space can compromise segments of a space ship, and, given time, an entire spaceship can be flooded with it. There are highly annoying leaks from the hull, which will threaten any stationary drones so you're never safe. There are also meteor strikes, although these are rare early in the game. Luckily you can get in your little docking vehicle and leave at any time. Of course then you won't get all the fuel and other resources you desperately need, and will have to hope for better luck on the next derelict. And finally the derelicts can be commandeered as well, effectively replacing your active ship between the missions. This gives various effects, but mainly affects how many mods the actual ship can have. For example commandeering a military ship often lets you fire weapons anywhere on a derelict you're exploring, while other ships will let you scan without using your drones or even power parts of a derelict power grid from the ship, leaving your generator drone free to do something else.Duskers can be somewhat frustrating at first. Each drone mod requires a bit of practice before you get the timing down. And while you're getting used to new things you will die. Over and over again. And because the game generates random ships every time, it never really gets predictable. The best tip is to abandon ship while you still can. Call me a coward, but fleeing at the first sign of trouble is the only reason I got anywhere in this game. I highly recommend being a coward. I also recommend Duskers. It's atmospheric , demanding and rewarding.",Skulb
1636,Severed,WiiU,9,"This game uses the analog stick and the touchscreen only, and it is the first action game to do that well. I've played Kid Icarus, Dillon's Rolling Western, and Liberation Maiden, and they were all kind of awkward and hard to get used to.

I've played Kid Icarus, Dillon's Rolling Western, and Liberation Maiden, and they were all kind of awkward and hard to get used to. Severed, on the other hand, is designed with this control scheme in mind. It is not an afterthought, a compromise, or a substitute for a pointer or second analog stick. It works.You're given a first person view, and travel around dungeons one room at a time. It feels a bit like Doom (90s) since you can't point up or down, but there's less freedom as you can only turn left, turn right, or exit the room. You explore, pull levers, pick up items by poking the touchscreen, and attack by swiping in specific directions (like Fruit Ninja or Theatrhythm). The limited mobility reminds me of point-and-click adventure games, but is far more intuitive.The game eases you into the controls gradually, so it feels natural very quickly. After you get used to walking, you're taught how to swipe to damage enemies and parry their attacks. It felt challenging at first, but an hour later, I was fighting multiple enemies at once. It was intimidating, turning the analog stick rapidly before an enemy could attack you.Walking through the dungeons has a slower-paced Zelda feel to it. You're equipped with a map and doing everything from pulling levers, lighting torches and using keys and stairs to reach the end of the level.It has an upgrade system, where the better you are at fighting, the more trophies you get, which you can spend to learn skills, like raising damage and armor. This seemed unfair to me at first, since enemies don't respawn in the dungeons, and I'm not great at fighting, but it encouraged me to improve and figure out how best to beat enemies.The game is very gruesome. The hacking and slashing is realistic, but even things like upgrades to the life meter and eating to regain health are a bit macabre. I like it, (it suits the story's tone) but others might be put off.On Wii U, you could play the entire game without looking at the tv screen, because all the action takes place on the gamepad. The default option is to put the map on the tv, but the graphics are so detailed that I decided to use the other option - mirroring them on the big screen. I can easily swipe the touchscreen without looking down, but you might find yourself looking less at your tv in more trying scenarios.Severed is an immersive experience and a novel game concept that works perfectly for Wii U.",moothemagiccow

""Demolition"" changes this by setting out guns you unlock by killing enemies with your current weapon, and you can get bonus grenades by performing well in the round.  Both new games are fun, and I have spent most of my time in GO playing them!Cons:1) Locked down netcode! - Anyone who has played CS of any type in the past will have tweaked the netcode to suit their specific connection/computer/taste.  Valve has locked the netcode down so much in GO that you cannot really fine tune your system. This is a big no no to me!2) Lack of maps - This may be something that will be addressed in the future through patches, but its the same old maps, and not many of them. You have Italy, Dust 1 & 2, Aztec, Office, Nuke & Train.  In standard game play scenarios you will get bored of these pretty quickly! That said, the new game play modes have added rehashed versions of old maps (i.e a short version of train), but to me it feels like there isn't enough content on launch to keep the audience entertained.3) Ever changing models - As an old player of source, I got used to the colours of CT = blue, Terror = red (or brown!). However, with CS:GO each map changes the models, which isn't so bad in itself, however on some maps the models are so close in colour, you cannot tell them apart from any reasonable distance, which leaves me hovering over a player to ascertain whether they are on my own side or not....very frustrating!!4) The cross-hair - I like the old cross-hair, however I tried to use it and it seemed useless, so I now have to use the abomination that is the ""new"" cross-hair.  You cannot change its colour (as far as I can tell) and it takes up so much room on the screen when your running around, its just annoying!  It does seem to recognize friendlies, so that's why I'm using it.  Overall, very poor!5) Clunky movement, and shocking physics - CSS may not have been the best 1st person shooter ever, but it felt fluid and smooth, however you come across GO and it seems very clunky, the players all run like they have a stick up their backsides and the physics are 10 years old (cannot shoot barrels now apparently!!).That all said, the game is certainly entertaining. Better than CSS? No, but its certainly enjoyable, and with a few tweaks of the engine, some new content I'm sure it will be here to stay.For the £12 I spent, I don't regret it, but if you are happy in CSS now, I would see the need to rush over immediately.",Ashcutus

First off: only buy this game if you are a huge fan of Final Fantasy or music games in general. Second off: if you are a huge FF junkie, should you buy a 3DS just to play this? Not by itself, but ifI’m happy to report everything positive from the first Theatrhythm game was enhanced in Curtain Call and many shortcomings were improved upon (read my review of the first game for more info). First off: only buy this game if you are a huge fan of Final Fantasy or music games in general. Second off: if you are a huge FF junkie, should you buy a 3DS just to play this? Not by itself, but if there are other 3DS games out there you’ve wanted to play, Curtain Call could be the final nudge you need. Third, here are some points on what was and wasn’t improved upon:- Repetition is still there, but not nearly as bad as it was. The “dark note” system received an overhaul and is now “quest mode”. Previously you would grind the same two songs repeatedly for either XP or a certain color of crystal shard. Quest mode gives you more songs and better rewards. Plus you always get a new quest when you beat one.- Less crystal shards required to unlock characters. In the first game, every character took 8 shards to unlock and you’d never get more than one shard at a time. In Curtain Call, some require as few as 4 shards to unlock and you can choose between 4-5 different characters per shard color! You also often get several shards at a time for quest and rhythmia collection rewards.- Deep cuts. There are tons of songs and characters before you think about DLC. Even FF Mystic Quest and Advent Children are included! There are a huge amount of tracks for the game to insert into the quests which, again, reduces the repetition.- More freedom with how to play. You can choose most tracks right off the bat and can play them one at a time rather than having to play three in a row from a certain game.- There are different input methods. I don’t remember this being an option in the first game. Instead of having to use the stylus for everything, you can also incorporate buttons, the circle pad, or even use a one-handed mode. Good stuff.- No cut-off tracks. A few songs from the first game skipped cool intro parts, like FFX’s Battle With Seymour or FFVI’s Dancing Mad. Not the case in the sequel. The full songs are here for your enjoyment, or at least I have not encountered any cut offs yet.- Online play is killer. Yes, you can play people head-to-head through the internets, not just locally via wifi. This is a really cool option. Even if you get your butt handed to you by some dude in Japan who has maxed all his characters and can play each song with his eyes closed, you still exchange the streetpass profi-cards which are great because you can attach quest maps to them. If you have a particularly good map, you can share it with others. The only problem you may have is finding someone online at the same time as you who wants to play. It may require some waiting.- More uses for the collecta cards. They can now be used to improve your character stats. Still haven’t played with this much, but it’s neat.- There is DLC available, but you don't feel like Squeenix cut corners on main game content in order to bilk you. The first game kinda felt like that as it left out some awesome tracks.Bottom line is this is that Curtain Call is a must-play game for Final Fantasy fans. You can safely skip the first game.",cidgrad01

The music sometimes drowns out the voice actors when they are talking.

It has over 10+ different modes in the game and it will show off the gorgeous OLED screen of the PS Vita. You can't afford to miss out on this gem.

The concept seems great.  It was described to me as a ""card-based rogue-like dungeon crawler with action RPG combat and CYOA-style mechanics.""  Sounds right up my alley!  Unfortunately, the awful balancing, terrible combat and total reliance on luck-based difficulty just make HoF2 alternatingly frustrating and boring.The combat itself is strictly Simon Says where you mash attack until a prompt appears, and then press the button the game tells you to.  It's incredibly stale almost immediately and feels like a half-assed attempt at ripping off the Batman games.  I thought that there would be some kind of exploration or something in these little battles but nope, you are in a circle and you fight enemies.  That is literally it.  After playing for a while, you begin to dread seeing combat cards more than any other, just because they halt the ACTUAL game completely for upwards of a minute at a time.  Every enemy takes at least 5-6 hits to kill no matter what weapon you are using, some taking more like 9 or 10.  And don't even get me started on bosses with armor that you have to bash against for 45 seconds or more just so you can actually start damaging them.  It's a horrible slog from the very first fight and the more you play the worse it gets.  The only time you will ever lose is because you get sick of it and just start mashing in frustration.So then since there is no actual difficulty in the combat, how does HoF2 challenge the player?  Well, it doesn't.  This game's idea of difficulty amounts to giving you 4 cards that fail you and 1 card that doesn't, and then making you pick at random.  Or maybe giving you 3 dice and telling you to roll a 15.  Or maybe just littering the map with an absurd number of trap cards, because the devs want to... punish exploration?  Yeah, I don't get it either.  There is zero strategy and the vast majority of the time that you lose, it will not be your fault.  I grew up playing D&D and game books like Forest of Doom, so I'm no stranger to RNG-based systems, but HoF2 consistently feels unfair in a way that those other games never did.  Being forced to grind the same mission 4-5 times in a row just so you can actually complete it and get your stupid gold token is the exact opposite of fun, and only serves to make the game grow staler even faster than it would without this crap.Basically, if you are playing for the tabletop aspect, I can't recommend this game.  It's too grindy, unfair and repetitive to be fun, and the experience is constantly being interrupted by the subpar combat.  But I can't recommend it to fans of action RPGs either.  I honestly don't know who this game is supposed to be for, or why anyone would play it.  It's probably the most disappointing game I played in 2017.",9DAN

Gamers not only learn the subtleties of growing an entrepreneurial business but also learn about leadership and team building necessary in any business situation."" ""Capitalism is very realistic and will allow the dynamics to change depending on whether you're selling a cola product, which is sort of a low tech-branded consumer good, or whether your selling consumer electronics or a PC."" Professor Drew Fudenberg Harvard University ""This game does an excellent job of modeling many of the key aspects of modern business. Not all aspects of it are realistic, but enough of them are that many sensible strategies are encouraged. In particular it's gratifying to me to see that the game rewards thinking about sources of long-term competitive advantage, be it from brand recognition, low production costs gained from learning-by-doing (a nice touch!), a monopoly on high quality inputs, or a big technological lead."" Businessweek, October 21, 1996 Capitalism isn't just for those who aspire to be the next Michael Dell or Sam Walton. It can be a fun and useful exercise for anyone who wants to test their entrepreneurial mettle without, for once, taking any risk. Players can choose to compete against computer-controlled rivals in four different industries: farming, manufacturing, raw material mining, and retailing. For a truly adventurous and time-consuming game, players can mix and match industries as captains of giant conglomerates. As in the real world, players compete locally, in one city, or fight it out on the global stage. With so many possibilities, Capitalism is an intense strategy game, much like chess, where players must constantly think ahead. As such, it could easily overwhelm novices. But by adjusting several factors--competency and managerial style of the computer-controlled rivals, for example, can be varied from very aggressive to conservative--gameplay can be suited to various styles and speed. The game even allows a player to hire presidents to manage the day-to-day operations of different divisions so the player can concentrate on the big picture. Far Eastern Economic Review, September 26, 2002 The mass market isn't the only audience for Chan's games. Like Virtual U, Capitalism has made the leap from game room to classroom. Because of its high degree of realism, the game has been used by professors at institutions like Harvard and Stanford Universities to help students learn basic business principles. Chan is hoping that Restaurant Empire and Hotel Giant will also be adopted for training and education. ""Simulation games are a fun way to learn about anything,"" he says. ""They prove that computer games aren't just about shooting things but can also be educational."" CNN - 22nd May 2002 Kristie Lu Stout, CNN Correspondent Some guys have all the luck. They have the billion dollar market cap, the brand, and the empire, while the rest of us spend our lives toiling away in cubicles with no chance to ever run the show. That is until now. Even the desk jockey can claw his way to the top in ""Capitalism,"" the game.Hong Kong game developer Trevor Chan just released the follow-up to the award-winning original, but the objective is the same. Move your assets to turn an upstart into the most profitable company in the world. First-time players can choose a challenge like, the world in your hands, where you manage a research and development lab out to post annual revenues of $400 million, and as you take on the competition, that's when the real drama begins.But ""Capitalism"" is no Business 101. Critics call it a deep involving game that could test even the sharpest business document. In fact, it's been used as a simulation exercise for business students at Stanford University.",CapAlive

This game offers a lot of content and different challenges that keeps me going for ages.But there are still some problems in the game that has been in the series for a long time. A lot of the problems that are the most annoying according to me are those that arise in saves that you have been playing for a long time. For example that the game almost never creates big upsets or changes in the footballing world. The teams in the Champions league are almost all the same year after year. The top teams in the biggest division are almost all the same too. The only chance for something new and exciting to happen is for you to control a team and make history yourself.And there are a lot of other problems such as the game becoming very slow after a few years and other problems that arise in long saves.

This year the players seem a little more.... ""grounded"" if you will. Jukes are much more effective with scat backs (no more coming to a complete stop prior to throwing a joke), and trucking/stiff arms with bigger backs actually works against DBs/smaller defenders.3.	The 3v3 MUT is sick. I love playing DB in career mode, but it gets a little tedious because the CPU doesn't make mistakes (such as throwing into double coverage), so playing against a user controlled QB is refreshing.4.	AI blocking is better. Not perfect, but better.CONS:Before I begin, I wanted to point out (in my humble opinion) it doesn’t matter how good the graphics are, how much effort you put into MUT for financial gain, how the CFM wasn’t even touched (even though YOUR WHOLE ENTIRE FAN BASE WANTED THIS ADDRESSED!!!)), how bad the commentary is, how the players still look like drunk rag dolls in the middle of an epileptic seizure, I could forgive these flaws…… as long as the game play is realistic. After all, that is why we purchase the game, correct? With that being said, here we go:1.This year, EA insists that ratings actually matter, so I put their theory to the test. I conducted a fantasy draft with two separate teams.For team A, I drafted of all (rated) 90+ defensive lineman, and for team B I drafted all 60-70’s (rated) offensive lineman. For team A, also I drafted highly rated linebackers (Hightower with a 91 overall rating, Levonte David at OLB), and for team B I drafted a mediocre RB/TE/FB combo (I believe it was Kareem Hunt).In theory, team A should win in the trenches every...single...time.The very first game (everything was CPU controlled, so ""user timing"" did not play a factor in the outcome) I watched Von Miller (who I changed to a DE) get COMPLETELY blown off the ball on a running play and pushed 10 yards down the field …….by Coby Fleener.Mind you, this was simulation mode, where individual ratings are supposed to matter (the ONLY game mode where ratings are paramount to user skill). Von Miller has (don't quote me on the exact ratings) a 97 block shedding rating, 95-97 finesses moves rating, etc. So why in the hell is Coby Fleener, a pass catching tight end with a 50 something run blocking rating, blowing up the MVP and driving him 10 yards down the field?Kareem Hunt ended the game with (I kid you not) 140 rushing yards on 17 carries. As a reminder, he was running against a defensive line with all 90+ ratings (as well as linebackers with 85-90 ratings) behind an offensive line with 60-70 ratings.So, unfortunately ratings do not seem to matter. I am hoping this gets patched, fixed with sliders, but to me it seems like another broken promise from EA.2. DL/OL interaction is so slow. My lord it's frustrating at times. Good luck trying to get your DT to make a tackle behind the line of scrimmage. As a result, there is a positive running play on almost every single carry (a complete 180 from last year's running game, which was almost too difficult).3.	Subpar QBs are still throwing dimes off their back foot. This goes back to bullet point #1, do ratings really matter?4. The CPU AI is useless, you can throw slants against their defense all game and they won't adapt. Non-user controlled players wander around the field with no purpose (especially on defense, where I've seen DBs run away from their coverage WHILE THE BALL IS IN THE AIR, defensive lineman diving at absolutely nothing..taking themselves out of the play, etc).I'd recommend watching RyanMoody21's Youtube Channel. He breaks down a tremendous amount of flaws in this year's game.I will say this, people are catching on. Trust me fellas, there will be a point in our lifetime where another company makes a legitimate football game, because year after year EA has shown they aren't capable of doing so.It's hilarious and almost sad to see just how complacent Tiburon is with mediocrity.",kp70724

This has been proven failed on Street Fighter X Tekken, where all the Tekken characters adopt the SF system. Not just that, Akuma is very well balanced too, it's hard to spam the hadoken within the game, you'll need to do close up combos using this character too, but nevertheless Street Fighter player will feel very at home using Akuma.Hopefully they will bring more cross over characters into this game (AFAIK Geese Howard from Fatal Fury is coming).",Exorio

Each element is capable of forming a different number of bonds. You playIt's about time Metacritic listed this game!If you haven't seen Northernlion's ""Let's Look At"" for this game (it demonstrates the game much better than I could explain it), Sokobond is a puzzle game where the goal is to form a chemical compound with the elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen) on the level. Each element is capable of forming a different number of bonds. You play as an atom of one of the elements, and if you move next to another element, the two elements will bond together if both have any remaining bonds. Once elements are bonded together, they start moving as one object. The difficulty comes from that if you form your molecule improperly, you may not be able to navigate around the level properly in order to form bonds with the atoms. Fortunately, each level has unlimited undos and can be reset easily, so a small mistake will not cause frustration. Upon completion, each level provides an interesting fact about the molecule you just formed.The level map plays an important role in progression in this game. Once a level is completed, the levels adjacent to the level you completed are unlocked. The game is divided into sections, and many of them introduce new mechanics. There is no order in which you must complete the levels; if you are stuck on one section, you can always attempt levels in a different section. There is an option to unlock all levels from the start, but I don't recommend using it unless you have been absolutely stumped on all of the available levels for hours.The game constantly mixes things up by providing new mechanics that add depth and complexity to the puzzles. Some levels have spaces that allow you to split bonds. Some levels have spaces that allow you to form double and triple bonds. Some levels have spaces that allow parts of your molecule to turn around corners. All of these mechanics are used in interesting ways.So far I have been talking on and on about how the game works and not about what I actually think of the game. So, what do I think of the game? I think this game is absolutely brilliant. The puzzles are quite difficult, but that makes them all the more satisfying when you solve them. There is also a huge variety in the puzzles; each puzzle is solved in a completely different way from the others. If I had to think of a complaint, it would be the lack of a level editor, but 144 puzzles is already quite a lot given the quality of the puzzles, and I don't think anybody could create puzzles as high quality as the ones created by the developers. All in all, a must-buy for any puzzle game fan.",InsertNumbers

I've heard other people make this remark about previous games, but I could run through Lego Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Batman, and Pirates over and over without losing interest. The biggest difference in this case is humour. it just doesn't have it. There are a few spots where I'll chuckle to myself about what a character has done, but most of the opportunities to make a funny joke or poke at the scene go unnoticed. Some of the great lines in the movies are cut out of the video game, of course to allow you to play through the three movies in less than 9 hours (near 11 or 12 for extended I believe).On the positive side, there are still some core mechanics that are there from previous Lego games where you bust bricks, take control of other characters, lots of unlocking of characters and extras, and amazing animation. Every game that TT comes out with keeps getting more amazing to look at. Even the textures and lighting are amazing allowing me to believe I'm playing the movies.As great as the game may look and as amazing as the animation is they don't live up to the fact that the core Lego game experience feels off. The game does feel like Middle Earth, but unfortunately, in the end, it makes me want to actually watch Lord of the Rings instead of playing this game.",Xatio87

The only one of these games which I ever went back to playing and actually liked was King Kong, or PJKK:TOGOTM. The game was designed by Michael Ancel, who recently cemented my admiration with Rayman Origins. KK has the usual issues with movie tie-ins: the game is stretched despite being 5-6 hours long, several aspects are unrefined and and Kong segments are arguably weaker than the rest of the game. Throughout the game you control Jack, a screenwriter who is probably one of the only FPS protagonists who actually speaks. The story is bare bones: pretty much the film but with little exposition and less complexity. In many ways, King Kong is a survival horror: you are equipped with only the barest necessity of firearms and/or spears which you chuck at a variety of dinosaurs and giant insects. Pacing is an issue, just like the film, and within 5 minutes of landing on the island, you'll find yourself fighting your first boss monster. The interface is bare-bones too, keeping your attention on the action. What I've said may sound slightly negative: but trust me when I say that King Kong is perhaps the best movie tie-in you'll ever play thanks to its brooding atmosphere and engaging design; just don't expect much in story or complexity.",FFStudios

This isn't ridiculously over-powered dribbling and charging around at 100mph, this is whatever you want it to be; precise passing, off the ball movement and possession based? You can do that. Sit deep and work on the counter? Sure. Big players and long ball tactics? That's there too.They have simply nailed it in all areas. Passing is sharp, shooting feels great, the AI find space and move brilliantly, the tactical depth is unmatched and that's before we get to the player and team styles. Players play like themselves; Robben, Ronaldo, Pirlo....they move and play like their real life self. The differences between each team is even better; Bayern pass you to death and press, Atletico sit deep and make it difficult, it makes every game different.The edit mode is missing a few things, but it's still terrific. You can fix just about everything from team/player names to kits and you can add missing teams; it makes the lack of licenses no big deal. Even the dreadful commentary doesn't get in the way, people new to PES will find it very, very basic and at times awful, but anyone who has played PES in the past will only laugh, over the years you even start to appreciate it.All in all, it is by far the best football game on the market.

The game also has some basic improvements over the original; the much-missed ability to play GP mode in split screen has finally been added and the themes of the tracks are much less repetitive. The only negative thing about this title is the way that you unlock extra characters. In the original you earned coins simply by playing, which you then could spend on unlocking anything you liked. That was a great addictive system. Transformed forces you to play through a world tour, which involves drifting challenges, survival races and other modes which I personally don't find particularly engaging. Not only that, but if you want to unlock all the characters, you have to play it through on multiple difficulty settings. This means that only the truly hardcore players will get the opportunity to play as the dwarf from Golden Axe. I don't appreciate that type of exclusion!

I love how much more brutal the world seems. Everything is well written and a feeling of despair clings over the episode like a dark cloud. Where this episode disappoints me is in the same area the first did: The gameplay, or rather the lack thereof.There are no puzzles to solve and only a few quick time events that are over in seconds. For the most part your key form of interaction with this episode is just to sit back and occasionally push a button to select dialog. That's not exactly gameplay. I get that the story has always been the focus of Telltale games, but where are all the puzzles that that the first season had? When the game does ask you to do something like search the environment for a way to progress, there aren't any distractions to throw you off from what you are really supposed to find. The answer is clearly placed in front of you so that the episode can quickly get past any sort of gameplay in order to get right back into the cutscenes.It's sad to see this series moving away from gameplay considering this is supposed to be a video game. I did feel like I was making an impact on how the story will turn out (despite a season 1 save glitch that imported my decisions wrong), and I am excited to see where the story goes from here. Truth be told the wait for the next episode is going to be unbearable as always, but considering I was watching WAY more than I was actually playing, I can't give this episode much praise from a gameplay perspective so that's why this episode doesn't receive a high score.Overall I do recommend the episode to fans, because the story are just fantastic. There are also some tough decisions to be made here. In the end though it sad to see that this series is becoming less of a game and more of a TV show. I wonder how long it will be before Telltale starts taking decision making out of our hands and just have us paying for something we solely watch. Maybe i'm being over dramatic with that assumption, after all their ""The Wolf Among Us"" hasn't turned away from gameplay, but the lack of any real interaction outside of the story does make me worry. In closing this is a fantastic episode as far as story goes, but when viewed from a gameplay perspective, well, it's not really much of a game anymore.",TheQuietGamer

But instead it's turned out to be derivative, generic, formulaic and represents everything that's mediocre about the genre from the year 2000 onward. Firstly, the game has been shoehorned primarily onto consoles and it's scattered with Quick Time Events. Some people say ""Oh, but they are easy QTEs"", and to that, I counter ""So why include them at all, when a cutscene movie would suffice?"" Seriously, whoever thought taking a retro game that's only ever been PC based and had PC fans, and heavily consolizing it needs to be fired. Clunky 3rd-person controls will never win over a point and click interface that creates many more opportunities to explore the game world. Stop trying to cater to every gamer out there and focus on the target PC fans that this franchise is intended for. It's a niche game!In A Knight to Remember, I felt that the game mechanics represented the worst of the two extremes commonly seen in bad adventure game design: Either the puzzles are overly simple because they're handed to you on account of all the important hotspot being the only ones you can interact with OR you're stuck wandering around aimlessly, through the confusing game world, trying to figure out what to do next. The graphics are awfully outdated and belong in the PS2 era. Another great shame, as KQ (except the 7th entry) has always been renown for it's pseudo-realistic, fairly tale look. The art style in the new game is cartoony and just doesn't look right.  When you can clearly count the number of polygonal lines edges on a ""circular"" pie tray that an NPC holds up, you know that the graphics could have been SO much better. I really didn't care for the art style at all.  I also despise the developer's attempts to redefine Graham's personality and character into a slapstick abomination. The tone and humor is really far off the mark and the writing also very average. I can't help but feel deeply dismayed and let down that this is what we got as the next KQ game, after a 17-year wait. Even those fan KQ remakes were infinitely more faithful to the series'  tone, characterizations, and puzzles, the very things that this series is know for.  Sadly, this new KQ game strays so far from the established conventions, that it strips away any semblance of what made Sierra's adventure games unique. What we're left with is a product that looks vaguely like KQ on the surface, and only because it uses the character likenesses, names, locations etc. But under the hood it plays and handles like a watered-down LucasArts title and anything uniquely ""Sierra"" is long gone or has been trashed. It's almost as if the devs are giving a big ""Screw you"" to Sierra's established mechanics... even the ones that worked and would have translated well into a modern adventure game. The whole thing just feels completely and utterly wrong. This game could have been so much more. It could have forged a new path and been revolutionary in the genre, like nothing before it, and like KQ games of old. Activision certainly has the money to fund this. But instead, A Knight to Remember tries to play it safe and the adventure genre as a whole, and particularly long-time Sierra fans, are worse off as a result.It seems to be that people are rating this game highly because they know Activision hold all the Sierra IPs ransom, and unless they kiss Activision's ass and **** around the negatives, they'll never see any more Sierra games made. But if they turn out anything like this one, then I would suggest maybe that's for the best. People also seem to be lauding this game because it does things slightly better than a Telltale game. Well, let me just sau that if this is the new benchmark for what makes a good ""modern"" adventure title, then I can only facepalm, and say that we clearly have a long, long way to go. Well, the gloves are off. We need to hold Activision to a far, FAR higher standard than this. A barely passable game is not good enough, and if they want to dabble in the Sierra IPs, they'll need to do so much better than this.If you're a long-time King's Quest fan, skip this.

One is based around food / gold, another around production / science, another around exploration and happiness, and the last one around military. The game is handled in ""ages""... but to advance to a new age, you don't need to go down every tree. You might completely ignore the military trees in the first age, and get them in the second or third one. You might go military early for expansion, then focus on military building later on. I especially loved this part of the game, because I dislike the linear tree in most games. I'm constantly experimenting with different research methods each time I start a game up.The tile system is somewhat similar to Civ, but it has FAR less RNG (thankfully). There's multiple types of ore to create weapons and armor with, so if you don't get one kind you can use another. Each kind is good, but specializes in a different area... one kind might give more defense, while another is lighter and gives more speed.The class system was somewhat disappointing... each empire is basically locked into one class. Luckily, you can build a mercenary camp VERY early (in the first age) and recruit heroes from other factions for gold, but you'll always be stuck with that first hero with the same class (unless you make a custom race). However, each class is unique and refreshing to play. I enjoyed all of them, which is unusual for me.Get out there and give these guys your money. I recommend the founder's pack, which is still for sale on steam... the game has a lot of heart, and it's obvious that these guys care about their player base.",Ixoziel

1786,Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure,3DS,5,"Sklanders Spyros Adventure  3DS isn't anything ground breaking really.

I completed the entire game in 2 hours 32 minutes. As well as that the final boss fight wasn't hard at all just dodging then attacking for a bit then going through a jump course. Plus the final cut scene is pretty good. However when you beat the final boss it just resets back to where you were before the final boss 'Hectore'. ANd to 100% complete it you have to buy all the expansion packs, buy 1 skylander from each element, get all the hats, get all the radiant crystals. The actual toys you buy though only give approximately 1-4 hours of extra play (by the time you level them up) even though the developers said there would be 10-15hrs added through each toy you purchase. I also was a bit sad to see that there wasn't a ""pvp"" option like in the other versions. It is for younger kids as the developers say so maybe they will enjoy it more. If your planning to buy something that's content wise DO NOT get this game though. I paid $88.00 for this game and didn't feel my money's worth. (Should've spent it on Skyrim). I know this review is going back and fourth with these points and I apologise. So this is a worse version of Skylanders Spyros Adventure, and I recommend getting a Wii, Xbox360, PS3, or PC version instead because it is a lot more fun addictive and more content.",Darkicicle

Playing the EMT Maria was one of the most immersive and stressful (but fun) gaming experiences I've ever had, and it had my heart was racing throughout all the scenarios.One downside of this game is the lack of replay value, especially with diagnostics and forensics, and although there are several stages for each profession, I finished the game craving more.

A decent story has always beenThe Far Cry series has given me a great deal of joy over the years and without a doubt it’s one of my most favourite series’s of all time and that’s mainly down to the uniqueness each game of the series brought to the table. Thankfully Far Cry 5 carries on this tradition extremely well and it’s that good that it’s my most favourite game of the series so far. A decent story has always been a prominent feature in Far Cry and thankfully it continues here. The story hooks you from start to finish and the writing shines through on all levels adding to the overall gameplay brilliantly throughout your time with the game. A new feature in Far Cry 5 is the added co-op option and this gives the game even more replayability and with the amount of content that’s available you won’t find yourself getting bored anytime soon. The main reason why you don’t get bored is because the world in which the game takes place feels alive at every turn. There is always something to do in this game and the amount of variety each quest has is absolutely fantastic and the variety doesn’t stop there because the enemies and combat also possess a huge amount of variety. The combat has seen significant improvements in my opinion and the amount of moves you can do makes taking down your enemies extremely satisfying at all times. The gameplay on the whole is also extremely satisfying at all times as well and that’s mainly down to all the different mechanics in play at the same time. I was especially impressed with the shooting mechanics in the game and you can definitely tell that a lot of effort has gone in here because everything always feels on point and most importantly the controls that have been implemented never fail you, which is great. I’m not exaggerating when I say that Far Cry 5 is basically perfect and my only gripe is the technical issues it suffers with every now and then, but these issues are only small and they don’t really take anything away from your overall experience. Far Cry 5 has never looked or sounded better and the presentation side of the game really does deliver in all areas and when the beautiful visuals and excellent sound design combine together it makes things become even more immersive and enjoyable. At the end of the day I can see Far Cry 5 being game of the year for quite a lot of people and without a doubt I can definitely see it being in my top five games of the year already, which is very impressive considering it’s only March. I can’t recommend Far Cry 5 enough because they’ve taken what was good from the previous games and improved them quite considerably whilst also adding new features at the same time and fans of the series will absolutely adore this fantastic approach.",Xbox_Alive

Nippon still looks gorgeous and even the sometimes oversized pixels make it for a crisp, beautiful presentation. The same can be said about the expanded soundtrack, which sounds as epic as ever.But unfortunately when it comes to content Okamiden fails to capture the grandeur of the original installment.The game takes you by the hand in so many ways that' it's hard not to state it was dumbed down. Predictable puzzles, prayers evolving your powers automatically, the very combat... Even the poor (or lazy?) decision of making it controlled by the D-Pad (instead of a more intuitive touch-only scheme like in the DS Zeldas) produces another step down: the camera compelling you to where you should go next.Chibi partnering a variety of companions throughout the adventure does help to freshen the experience and show the intended protagonist's fragility, but in the long run much of the plot and dialogue is plain dragging for the sake of it. What would be an otherwise charming cast of characters can grow annoying and tiring after some time.That aforementioned overall mood/pace twist could have made it for a perfect kids-friendly first RPG... But the overly complex boss battles create difficulty spikes that can get in the way and turn beginners down.Okamiden would fare better if it was conceived as a spin-off, or at least as a more compact title. As a main entry with the responsibility to carry the name on it just feels expendable.",julianozuca

Thankfully The Evil Within 2 continues this trend and in some ways it improves on the original game. The enemies you face in the game have a decent amount of variety to them and the best thing is that they’re actually scary at times. The enemies also make the combat scary and this fear when in combat makes the game stand out for all the right reasons. I was however frustrated when it came to the camera because the awkwardness of it did hinder me at times, especially when I was in dire situations. I also wasn’t a big fan of the shooting mechanics in the game and the main reason for that is because it didn’t have much fluidity and when shooting it instead felt clunky. There is however a decent variety when it comes to the weapons so you don’t have to use a gun if you don’t want to because there’s plenty of things for you to craft. My favourite thing about the game is that it allows you a lot of freedom through exploration, and this is great because it stops the game from feeling linear. The presentation side of the game is awesome and can really create a scare or two. I was especially fond of the art design in the game because I thought the gore was done to perfection. At the end of the day while the few niggling problems the game has stops it from being a masterpiece there is still a very good game here. The main and most important thing The Evil Within 2 did is that it kept things interesting and exciting throughout, and with the added fear factor thrown in for good measure it made it difficult for me to put the game down. Fans of the first game will love The Evil Within 2 and if you’ve never tried an Evil Within game before then I suggest you check it out.",Xbox_Alive

Skyrim consists of thousands of missions, keeping your mind company for many hours. From joining the dark brother hood and becoming a blood thirsty assassin to buying a house in a nice village. The game contains hundreds of devastating dragons and bandit camps that can be killed and looted.As the game starts, your character – who can be customized from any number of humanoid races. The ability to contain resources to craft your own weapons and armor is amazing and unique. Skyrim is the most enjoyable thrilling game out there to this day. The game also consists on hundreds of skill level ups which drives you to be the best out there. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds – the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user – but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic.The truly inspiring thing about Skyrim is the fact that you start as a useless peasant who is about to have their head chopped off. However the menacing dragon jolts the axe and your life is saved. However when the game is completed you are a rich player with a lot of power. This is truly inspiring and definitely a very addicting game, and on top of the huge story line the game is also jam packed with interesting side quests which lasts for many hours.Your character is very unique, you can change almost everything. You will also have tons of personal skills. For example lock picking, charisma, magic etc. You have to decide what skill tree you want to invest in. This makes the game feel unique in a way that nobody has the same person as you and every character is different in its own way. The game also allows you to roam the beautiful woods and pretty towns. The best way to travel is by horse. They run like the wind and look elegant and beautiful but they come with a large price. Money is also a large aspect of the game.

Now you can be boring & speed Sonic up the advance way (run till the after images show up) or you can use your tricks to your advantage press y or x and RUSH to get an instant speed boost! this with the amazing level design makes Sonic Rush an instant classic. there parts of the level though where you jump & you're doing your tricks and all of a sudden an enemy is there to ruin your combo, but they're easily ignorable. the game has its minor flawss though but again, they're minor but are what prevented the game from getting that perfect score. for example, the boss fights. they're either very easy or extremely irritating. the fact that I can only hit the boss when he (or she, blaze) is in position really makes it slow paced, and if i miss, i gotta wait till he's in position again, ugh! and then there is blaze. nothing really terrible about her but if you ask me, seems like she is begginer oriented with her no bonus levels, slower speed yet superior aerial abilities which really makes versus mode unbalanced. foix that and this would be a perfect game. Sonic Rush is most definitely a must have for ANY sonic fan!!!",MarlonB.

Soundtracks are good for example Black Betty by Spiderbait that really makes you going fast. Physics are not so good because this a fun arcade game, not a hardcore simulator.

The content-over-graphics approach is reminiscent of Space Empires IV; even then, I don't see the sprite graphics as negative given the vast number of units that can appear on the battlefield.  With over a thousand  well-drawn and animated sprites, large-scale fortress invasions, and amount of units that can be fielded, sprite graphics feel like a feature rather than a limitation.The user interface is easy to learn and, in my opinion, better most turn based, 4x strategy games (that includes Space Empires IV, Galactic Civilizations II, Civ. II, Civ. III, Civ. IV). Strategy isn't dumbed down, and the game is probably more repayable than most of those combined.  Functions are placed intelligently.  The AI appears to be well capable, and even though multiplayer has a pretty big following, I'm still learning which faction to play - factions are pretty interesting and not rehashed versions of each other or simply paper, rock, sissors (i.e. Gal Civ. II combat).  My experiences playing most factions  - particularly EA Ermor to LA Ermor and EA Ulm to LA Ulm - was as if I tried a completely different game.  The game appears to have a great development team which, for a game that was surprisingly balanced and whole to begin with, continually release new content for the game (more factions, heros, unit graphics, etc.).",RussellB

In this mode, you can play on your own with no opponents, no item boxes, and 3 Mushrooms at the start. Multiplayer mode was nice, but it needed far more modes. Wi-Fi, too. The only thing that I still play Mario Kart Wii to do is race Time Trial ghosts. That was fun.

The art is beautiful. Most notable were the character portraits. Brilliant artwork. The voice acting was also really well done.So, a great story, beautiful art, and solid voice acting. What's the catch? Well, just like most point and click games, this game suffers from convoluted puzzles that often make no logical sense, and at times even require you to have the knowledge of how things in the game's fictional setting work, like wetware or trance. Don't get me wrong - some of the puzzles were fun and executed well, but many others require you to have a walkthrough on hand, especially in the last two chapters. It just horribly breaks the pace of the story.The game also offers some choices. It was a great touch, though many don't seem to make much of a difference to the story. I was especially annoyed by the ending, which felt like a false choice (for spoilers sake I'll say no more).So to conclude, although I enjoyed a lot of parts of the game, it left me feeling disappointed.

Interesting storyline.Cons: Some immersion breaking red/white light pixels that flash in the distant tree line. No indication as to when you've triggered the autosave (no option to save where you want to), so it's a gamble when you stop as to how much you might need to repeat. Can't invert the mouse (option is there, but it's broken).

1870,Duelyst,PC,10,"This is the deepest, most challenging, most fun, and least cost-prohibitive card game on the market right now, despite what some negative reviews may say.Pros:1) FAST card generation. A pack costs 100g, and you get ~50g from easy daily quests (play 4 games as X faction), 20g for your first win of the day, 5g for the daily puzzle, and 15g for every 2nd win. If you miss a day ofThis is the deepest, most challenging, most fun, and least cost-prohibitive card game on the market right now, despite what some negative reviews may say.Pros:1) FAST card generation. A pack costs 100g, and you get ~50g from easy daily quests (play 4 games as X faction), 20g for your first win of the day, 5g for the daily puzzle, and 15g for every 2nd win. If you miss a day of quests you get a Welcome Back bonus of 5g/missed quest. You'll generate a big collection in no time without paying a single cent. Some of the top players competing in tournaments have never spent a single dollar.2) High legendary drop rate. The community has collected data on thousands of orb openings, and determined that 1 out of 4 packs contains a legendary! Plus the legendaries aren't as OP as Hearthstone, so they feel more fair when played against you. Granted, you need them for the most competitive decks, you can certainly get by without most of them. You'll get some sick legendaries in no time.3) Duelst is a UNIQUE card game, with a key difference that makes this game shine above all the other card game on the market. The 5x9 board makes the game come to life. You need to just play a match and you will understand how much depth the board adds to the game. Positioning is everything, this is the steepest part of the learning curve, but the most important and the most rewarding to master.4) Less RNG compared to other card games. You can REPLACE a card in your hand every single turn, for free. Don't like that super high cost minion on turn 2? Replace it and get something you can actually use. The replace mechanic adds a huge amount of CONSISTENCY and SKILL to the game. The best players know what to replace, and when. A novice or even an intermediate player will often replace away exactly what they needed one or two turns in the future.5) Fantastic lore. If you listen to the first chapter of the fully narrated story of the world of Mythron, you will likely fall in and never return the same. The world is tangible, and deals with themes such as: Evolution of life on a hostile planet, the slow dawn of the first conscious civilizations, an epic journey by early explorers to the farthest reaches of the planet, formation and separation of nation-states, corrupt politicians and leaders, and much more. There is a fully-realized world map that accompanies the game. They are releasing more lore with every major patch, so the story is on-going.6) 4 New cards released every month, and you earn them for free if you finish the month ranked Silver or better. Gold rank ensures you get the monthly legendary. These cards often shake up the game, so the meta is never the same from month to month.7) Fun. I've played for 3 seasons and loved every match. Suffered some heart-breaking defeats along the way, but it just makes the wins even sweeter.If you like card games even a little bit, give this game a try. I couldn't stand Hearthstone, but I love this game. Duelyst is honestly better than Hearthstone in every way, as it is more fun, has a higher skill cap, less RNG, easier gold generation, and more.Cons:1) A few archtypes dominate the meta at the high ranks. This is to be expected as players figure out what works the best. Counterplay is good at balancing when necessary, so nothing is too far out of balance for long.2) Cosmetics are overpriced, especially the emotes, but not buying them has no effect on gameplay, so just ignore them and you're good!Give it a try, I think you'll be surprised by how much is packed into this little game.Add me in-game if you want any tips or want to play a friendly match:-Flantor",Flantor

Here's everything about vermintide that sucks.-Artificial difficulty. You are a slow, fat, legless slug that must drag your misshapen heap of a body to and fro in blatant defiance of gods will. Your enemies trained their whole lives with cirque du soleil. Each of you can usually one shot the other at higher difficulties, especially if you pick up the books that cut your health by 66%. This game isn't difficult like spinning plates or hitting a three pointer, it's difficult like chewing gravel.-Unavoidable damage. Even playing properly you will almost certainly take a lot of damage. This is especially irksome during boss fights.-One way no return drops. Don't ever get caught on top of one alone because if you go down because a special spawned on top of you and grabbed you, your team has no way of rezzing you because for some reason you can't crawl in last stand.-The playable characters. I mainly play kerillian, and i wan't to rip her sarcastic, quipy little tongue out of her smug **** face. And then I want to do the same with the rest of the reprobates whose skulls I inhabit. There is no way to just mute the characters voices either, because fat shark has nothing but contempt for their players and you're gonna experience every line of dialog every game or you can go **** yourself.-Specials. 3/5? specials have the ability to grab the player through guard and pin them, slowly draining health. A special **** you to the assassin which can leap over a hundred metres and often from behind cover. Why not just roll a die every few minutes to decide if the player should continue or restart.-Item crafting. The only draw of this game is grinding for 300 gear score, and fat shark knows this, so they dribble and drip items at a slugs pace. After getting up to about 150 or so, don't expect to get any usable gear in any given play session, because you likely won't. Just a small mound of tinder to burn for materials.-Tomes. The game doesn't reward individual skill as much as it does meta knowledge about the 5 collectible books on every level, often hidden in obnoxiously difficult to find places. They never move and completing the level without at least 3-4 is almost pointless, so get ready to study a wikia to make sure you arnt pissing up a tree for half an hour.-Toxic community. Even though there is no benefit to getting the most kills, kill whoring is rampant, even if it means shooting your own teammates. Even if it means taking damage yourself. I also distinctly remember being called **** retarded for not knowing where all the books were on a level i had played once.-Samey levels. If I ever made a game where there are only 16 small maps, I would at least make sure they were highly distinct from one another. This is not the case. Not that there is any story worth getting invested in (or at all), but the writers couldn't come up with 16 different objectives for you to complete, and 4 are already just crappy boss fights. There's like 3 missions that revolve around ringing a bell.-Story. It's like a really god awful super friends or something. There's a portal, you **** around for 15 levels, then you break the portal. There's no development, no character arcs, no point. Why is this even a warhammer game? to cynically cash in on an established fan base and make the L4D skin suit you're wearing seem more appealing by stretching it grotesquely around the frame of another established franchise? Maybe all of warhammer is thinly veiled plagiarism covered in slimy dog **** i don't know, I've never seen any of it so maybe it is.Bottom line. This game is fun like smoking crack is fun. First you have to blow a guy for 20 dollars, then you have to not get stabbed knocking on your dealers door because he lives in a bad neighborhood, then you have to make a stem out of a nip bottle, then smoking it tastes like battery acid and burns like poison, but after its all done you get high for a few minutes before you have to start over again. That is this game. An indeterminate amount of suffering then a cathartic high when you get to open that golden loot box. For some people that's a game. To me that's a destructive personality trait.",asddsaa

When fielding, the camera can't be controlled and the ball often leaves the screen, becoming incredibly tedious to track down. It's impossible to control the 'sense of urgency' for a throw, as your players will occasionally meander around for 2-3 seconds before throwing the ball (even if a runner is bearing down on first).Hitting is more ""pre-ordained"" than ever before - awful swings where you should not have even made contact often result in home runs, while perfectly timed swings result in weak grounders or popups.The pitching mechanics are the same as previous installations and aren't worth mentioning.",Wootif

After several tutorials and many pages from the instructional pdf I was finally firing my first missiles at an LAV 25-with success. The game gets more and more enjoyable as you play it. Black Shark's graphics are well done but the true beauty of Black Shark is in the intense flight model and attention to detail when it comes to making this flight sim.

1887,Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack,Switch,8,"Azure Striker Gunvolt is back, and on the Switch this time. The original games were on the 3DS, dating back to 2014 and 2016 respectively. If you're familiar with them, this is a nice way to snatch them up together with all the DLC and the option of playing on a larger screen. Plus the Switch's handheld screen is larger and the system more powerful. The game does look a bit pixelated onAzure Striker Gunvolt is back, and on the Switch this time. The original games were on the 3DS, dating back to 2014 and 2016 respectively. If you're familiar with them, this is a nice way to snatch them up together with all the DLC and the option of playing on a larger screen. Plus the Switch's handheld screen is larger and the system more powerful. The game does look a bit pixelated on the big screen, but it IS meant to appeal to the retro crowd...For those unfamiliar, this is a platformer made in the style of Megaman Zero/ZX, but it's hardly a clone. You follow the titular character, Gunvolt (real name unknown) on a quest to topple an evil syndicate called The Sumeragi group. And in the second game, an organization called Eden. Both bent on, you guessed it, World Domination.The action focuses on speeding through levels, killing enemies, collecting goodies, and ultimately beating the bosses. Challenges can be accessed for stages after initial completion, adding to replay value. It keeps things fresh and involved while you attempt to beat your high score, or farm materials for equipment.Equipment is used in this game in a variety of ways. It can give you more durability, improve your moves, or in some instances, remove the game's modern conveniences for a more hardcore experience. The materials are won from completing challenges and by collecting items from a series of boxes after completing each level. Your score dictates how many you can open initially, but you can collect medals through each stage to win more chances. The lottery aspect can be annoying at times, but satisfying when you get juuust the right item.Combat is fun and unique. Your gun is mostly just there to tag your opponent and does only light damage. Lightning provides most of your punch, channelled into your opponent directly and in varying degrees, depending on how many times you tagged your target. When playing Gunvolt 2, you get a second character, Copen, who plays completely different. He glides around with a rocketpack, rarely spending any time on the ground. He jets around and tags enemies by crashing into them, then shooting them. Unlike GV's arsenal, Copen's is quite lethal. He also has the Megaman style ability of taking boss's abilities and using them against each other in the old ""this boss's weapon beats that other boss"" style rock, paper, scissors method.The bosses are what you would expect from a Megaman game. Minibosses are usually huge and provide moderate challenge. Stage bosses are colorful characters that will banter with GV or Copen, if you have that option selected. Unfortunately these are no English VAs, but text is provided to distract you as they pummel you. The fights vary from boss to boss. Some are easy breezy, others require a bit more attention and forethought. They all possess a super move (that also varies in splendor from boss to boss) that will trigger after you have depleted 2/3rds of their health, and can be triggered again from that point until their death.The story is surprisingly deep for a platforming game and well crafted. It's not terribly original though, using many tropes from anime and many story themes from the X-men. The characters will banter throughout stages just as they do during boss fights, and this is still completely optional. Unlike the Playstation-era Megaman games Gunvolt resembles, the conversations won't stop your character from moving or progressing. There are also plenty of cutscenes, though none are animated. It's all splash images with dialogue bars. The art is top notch, though.The Striker Pack also has some difficulty tunings and some minor level and item location changes. It unfortunately suffers from being $40, where each game could be bought on the 3DS eshop for $14.99 each and found frequently on sale for lower. Is the extra price hike worth it? That depends on you. If you're spoiling to add a kickass game to your Switch, sure. If you're the frugal type, or if you already own the 3DS versions, you may reconsider. It's already a great platformer, though, and a very worthy successor to the Megaman Legacy. If that's not your jam then you may not enjoy this game. Some looking for a Megaman fix may also be offput by how not-Megaman the game actually is. It has its own style, and it's fresh. The game is not perfect by any means, but it's still a joy to handle. If you're still feeling trepidacious, at least give the first game a shot on the 3DS.On a final note, the endings... are not something I wish to spoil, but I would like to make note that neither game's 'true' ending is available the first time you beat the final boss. If you want that ending, and I hope you do, you'll be coming back for seconds.",Lowkey

The vistas are comparable in awe inspiring quality to Red Dead Redemption. I've read a significant deal about pop up in this game, but for me, I didn't notice it once.    GAMEPLAY: is my only gripe and what keeps this from a 10. Whilst the fighting is fun, the combos are extremely limited with respect to the animations. Also, when fighting multiple enemies you have to know where they are so that the spastic camera doesn't hide them. This isn't so much of a problem once you get past the first few hours. The climbing mechanic is fluid and the un-lockables for fighting and movement later on are simply awesome.    STORY/CHARACTERS: Is to an acquired taste. For me the monkey/trip relationship was executed brilliantly as was the ending... though please, please,  don't dismiss it at face value like so many on the forums I've read... and that's all i'm saying without spoiling anything :P The voice acting is sublime. Nothing more needs to be said about this really. The set piece action is also something that has the be experienced as it doesn't overcompensate ala Call of Duty but finds the sweet spot between repetition and pure unadulterated fun.MUSIC: Perfectly orchestrated. Fits the mood of a post apocalyptic world, but playful at the same time.Overall: Small, and may I emphasise: *small* gameplay gripes are what hamper this otherwise masterful example of game design. I don't give it a 10 because a 10 is reserved for games I believe don't break the immersion and are, for lack of a better word, perfect. This game, if metacritic allowed for it, would easily be a 9.5.",Martyn

When the game starts, you can see the amazing use of anime scenes, sprites and gameplay. Disgaea are known for their jokes and comical story and...totally true, even if this game has a good story, you cant really take it seriously because of...SARDINES. Sardines everywhere. Still, I´ve laughed a lot while playing and still didnt lose interest on how the story. Now that I´ve talked about the story (8/10) and the visual style (10/10), I have to talk about the most surprising part of this game, the gameplay. I thought that they were similar to games like FFTactics or Fire emblem but even if it looks like that, its far more...complete, not hard. I suppose that if you played every Disgaea, you should know about the Item World, Geo Blocks, Magichange and everything but for someone new to the serie its BIG. Even after I got it a month ago I still keep discovering new things (new classes, new options)... its just amazing. Besides, this version brings all DLC´s from the PS3 version wich makes this...yeah, HUGE.With all that I´ve said until now I have to give this game a 10, its my personal discovery of this year, I love it and I think that I still have a lot to play and enjoy.TL;DR Story: 8/10, Graphics (10/10), Gameplay (15/10), Duration (15/10), Music (8/10).",AlberKratos

It corrects and improves on a number of things from the original though I have to admit that there are some translation errors but it's hardly something that really effects the game.I seriously recommend picking this game up if you love a good plot and fun characters who will surprise you with depth (especially if you've played the later entries in the series).

However, there’s an added layer of complexity, as each of these bugs can beShe Remembered Caterpillars is a simple isometric puzzle game where you navigate colored bugs across bridges and through obstacles to reach their destination.This game includes a relatively small number of core mechanics. There are three colors of bug – blue, red, and yellow – and these correspond to obstacles. However, there’s an added layer of complexity, as each of these bugs can be combined with exactly one other bug, generating purple, orange, and green, which also correspond to obstacles. These combined bugs can then be split back apart, yielding their original constituent bugs. On top of this, there are colorless bugs and, in one stage, a black bug which counts as *every* color.The obstacles mostly are color coded. There are colored bridges, which require a bug of the right color to cross. Combined bugs count as being *both* colors that they are, in addition to their third, combined color, meaning that a green bug (blue + yellow) can cross a blue bridge, a yellow bridge, or a green bridge. The combined color bridges (purple, orange, and green) can *only* be crossed by the combined bugs – being just one constituent color or the other is not good enough.The opposite of these are colored blockers, which will allow anyone *except* a bug of the matching color through – so a red barrier will allow any non-red bug through. Combined bugs count as both of their component colors, so if either bug is the “wrong” color, they can’t get through these barriers – and, unlike the bridges, a combination color (such as green) will block not only the combination, but also the individual bugs that can combine to form that color – thus, a green barrier will *only* allow red and colorless bugs through.There are also color swappers – if a bug of the matching color walks up to one, they will lose their color and become colorless. If a colorless bug walks up to one, they will gain the color of the color swapper.Finally, there are beetle bridges, which only allow bugs over in a single direction. However, the catch here is that this direction switches every time a bug walks across a bridge – so if a bridge starts out as left to right, and then a bug walks across it, it now only runs right to left. This allows bugs to freely cross back and forth across these bridges, but if you need to get two bugs across such a bridge, you’ll have to find some clever work around – you cannot combine them into a single bug, as it won’t allow combined bugs to cross the bridge.While this is a small number of mechanics, it ultimately results in a pretty decent variety of puzzles – and while all of the levels are quite short, each taking no more than a couple minutes to solve if you know what you’re doing (and most taking under a minute), you are likely to spend much longer than that on many of the later levels, as you have to figure out ways to use the level mechanics to maneuver the bugs into the correct positions in the right order. Each puzzle element is gradually introduced over the course of the game, starting off with a tutorial level of sorts for each mechanic before making things ever more increasingly complicated, and by the 29th level, all of them have been introduced, beyond which point the puzzles freely combine all the mechanics into various challenging patterns. I beat the first 12 levels within about 15 minutes or so, but it took me about 4 hours to defeat all 40 of the levels in this game.At the end, however, I’m left with this quandary: is the game actually something I’d recommend?It certainly isn’t bad, and a number of the puzzles were reasonably clever. I would often be frustrated by some of the later puzzles, feeling like they were impossible to solve, until I got a sudden insight, at which point, solving it would be simple. A lot of it was about ordering, or realizing that I was missing a critical route which would allow me to free up a bug for another task I needed it to do.However, at the same time, I can’t say that this was something that really wowed me in any way. The overlying “story”, such as it was, was not anything I could really get invested in, and was kind of confusing to read in fits and snatches, as my brain was wholly preoccupied with the puzzles rather than the few lines of text that appeared between each level.That just leaves the game itself – and while it is a decent and reasonable puzzle game, it isn’t anything that really left me excited to tell other people “Yeah, you should play this!” It was, more or less, a thing to do – something experienced for a few hours, then discarded, likely to never be thought about again.This leaves the game overall in the sort of position where someone who is into puzzle games might find it a mildly amusing diversion, but it is just average in that regard; I wouldn't go out of your way to acquire this game, but if you are a puzzle fan and already own a copy, it is okay.",TitaniumDragon

I would often dread starting a new climb-the-tower sequence and after a while just couldn't wait for it to end. Additionally, I think while it was an interesting idea to have a karma meter for something other than a simple good/bad dichotomy, it just doesn't work. You're asked the question ""do you like golf or baseball"" and one of these corresponds to Katherine and the other to Catherine. It's completely arbitrary. I did like the story and was genuinely engaged in the mystery surrounding what was going on, but another major problem I had was the way this game handles a key component of its narrative: gender relations. It's the ""It's okay to treat and portray women in overly negative ways (over-controlling on one hand and overly flirty on the other) as long as we portrays guys in the same way (all men are cheaters)."" The Sucker Punch approach, if you will. I think they oversimplify things for the sake of the game's theme. I have to say, I admire Atlus for really thinking outside the box and pursuing something that surely was a passion project, I just think the pieces don't quite make a cohesive whole.

There's some joy to be had from spelling words that are ""dirty"" in nature and getting away with it. There's also a few secret words that it will take that aren't in a normal dictionary. It's a cute game. There's also a little bit of strategy involved with the powerups you can obtain throughout your adventure. However, there are a lot of tiny things that really outright annoys me. Let's start with that the game won't take some perfectly valid words. It's in the dictionary. Yes, the word may have some other meanings that parents wont like, but what parent actually parents these days? I'm an adult. I can handle these words. The next issue is the whole gem system. Certain letters seem to have more value over another letter. If you spell a word that's five letters long with those higher valued letters, you may get a green gem. Otherwise you may get nothing. The word could only be seven letters long and you just might get a purple gem. That is very very annoying. I'd rather see more consistency. Certain word lengths yield gems, not gems based on the value of the letters that you use. However, the greatest peeve I have with this game is how some bosses have nearly undefatable combinations unless you have a huge stock pile of certain potions so their attacks won't cripple you. Healing, with poision and bleeding and tile smash and petrify and freezing with heavy armor and immunity to fire and poison, and the ability to make your attacks less effective just makes a boss near invincible. While there are certain items you have at that point in the game that ""resist"" that sort of thing, the chance of it doing so are very slim, giving you nearly no hope because the boss keeps healing himself (and freezes you at the same time, something which you have no counter for at that point in time). There is fun to be had, and with STEAM selling it for half price right now, it's worth the money. $15, yes, $30, no.",MikeO.

And doing so the only way you know how...With guns…This campaign is a blast and the dialog and storytelling is lighthearted comedic relief in the style of borderlands…you have a leash that you can use to pull enemies into you or into spikes in the environment, you can kick them away and shoot them as they go slow mo in the air…And killing enemies in all of these different ways gives you more skill points which are spent on both upgrading your weapons you unlock throughout the campaign as well as for buying ammo itself…Enemies do drop ammo and there are occasional ammo crates.. but you’ll most likely be refilling your gun with bought ammo…And you do run out fairly fast, thankfully you are able to carry 3 weapons at once and the game is very generous with its skill points, so you never feel desperate…Each weapon also has a charged attack just in case you do run out of ammo and don’t want to switch to a new weapon right away or of course use them on the mini boss enemies you run into…But the delivery of this campaign is brilliant…Its fast paced, varied, and never overwhelms you...it isn’t just enemies around every corner...it gives you downtime of crawling through tights spaces or climbing across gaps…of listening to the banter between you and the characters you meet..This spacing allows enemy encounters to be fun instead of a nuisance…My only complaint with this game at all is the fact that your squad is practically useless..There’s an annoying enemy for example that you can only do damage by shooting its back… and he of course has a magnet in him that follows you, never pays attention to your squad members… and they’ll just stare at him instead of shoot his back..It’s frustrating and does hurt the flow of the gameplay a bit…And enemies feel a little too bullet spongy...I hated using the assault rifle here even though in shooters that’s my favorite weapon type…Enemies take like 2 full clips to kill.. which had me ignoring that weapon for most of the game and just sticking to heavy damage weapons like the shotgun…And the final annoyance.. The sniper rifle... you have to steer the bullet in air... no thanks.After you complete the campaign you can play again with all guns unlocked and equipped from the start so you aren’t stuck with just 3, and there’s also an echo mode where you can chase high scores and a multiplayer mode…Which is dead… during launch week.. So yeah… good luck.This is basically a survive as long as you can with a group of up to 4 players. Killing waves of enemies as they come at you...And when I say the mode is dead...

Bfore that let me just clarify that I know well that this game looks dated and has numerous bugs, but my score makes these elements irrelevant. Firstly you remember in I am not joking when I say this is the most original PS3/360 game out there. Rather than go through all of the things that ake this game so brilliant I would rather tell you everything that makes this better than GTA IV. Bfore that let me just clarify that I know well that this game looks dated and has numerous bugs, but my score makes these elements irrelevant. Firstly you remember in GTA IV where serbian fag Nico has to do all those tutorials on how to implement the game mechanics effectively? Saints Row 2 wastes no time in letting you fuck shit up with intent. You don't get your cousin phoning you up ever 5 mins asking you to go and collect his dirty landerie from his gay sailors house. Basically what I'm getting at is that GTA IV desn't know what it wants to be at all, Saints Row 2 goes 5 steps ahead by having a naked superman fly out of a jet and land ass crack first on a police officer. Game conventions mean nothing in Saints Row 2, that's why its so good and fun to play, not to mention all the side missions you can embark on.",JamesD.

1926,Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga,PC,2,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        At first i thought this would be a good game, but then... There were a fet good appandages but i got bored very fast and so i cannot agree with the positiv scores all around here. So i want to write what destroys a game that could have been a good one, but failed in many points. At first the Graphic: All things are looking sterile and every place seems to have the (almost) the same fittings. The same amphoras are almost everywhere and it all looks to clean and shiny. But furthermore.. The Monsters: I hate the monsters in this game and that's why: They look different but are countless in numbers, are dumb like bread and have all the same skills. The skeleton mage hast the same skill like the goblin mage and the demon mage and so on and on.. there seems to be no really difference apart from the level. And you can nuke them away with a single...-> Skill of yours. So thats the next problem.. you have dozens of skills but you need only one or two on the highest level to simply nuke all enemys away. It works (almost) everywhere and thats no fun at all. But.. in contradiction therefore if you took points into a wrong skill the enemys can defeat you easily and it was impossible to get through the game till the developer made a patch for that problem. Now you can reskill your char for quiet a bit money and that is a system which is ok in a MMORPG but not in a Single-Player Game were you eventually spent all your money before and cant get anymore cause the all enemys on your level are defeatet already. But the biggest drawback in this game is the story. Thats the mainpoint i did not like. At first i have to tell that there are many many good apandages but they are all destroyed by the speed you are pulled through the story. This speed feels like you are handcuffed in a rollercoaster without the possibility to realy enjoy the ride. There is no time for character depths neither yours nor the enemy. You only get some little ruins of story if you met one of them or get some of the many books you can find all around the game but its still very very less information and nothing that could create some action. You get the feeling you did not really know why you kill dozens of stupid enemys and bosses and whats it all about.That happens very early in the game. Its like you are there and whoaaa.. you have to kill the last dragens because of some things really far ago and then... whooaa.. you are a dragonknight instead which seems to change nothing at all (ok you have a few new enemys to kill which were your friends before- but thats accented my point of view cause it destroys the possibility of charackter depth once more)Ok you could say.. : ""Yes, the game has no charakter depth and very funny stupid monsters which re-enact all over ( like diablo monsters?)but i say: The skill system is really bad, so the game cant get a point..you probably could say: Ok, the story is really really bad but look at games like gothic and so on.. that games storys are bad too. and they are fun anyway..Yes, but Divinity 2 sucks in that point too, cause there is no interesting world around you, you could explore.. the world is really, really small and sterile..Last but not Least: The dragon form: It is no fun at all to fly around as a dragon at getting attacked by roughly 100 turrets that don't get one hit on you. The big number of that turrets seems to be really absurd and points on the weak AI of the game. But thats not all. You cannot destroy anything else besides this turrets or enemy dragons (or flys-whatever) cause the engine sucks at that point. The area is static and indestructable even small doors can withstand your dragon power and all the enemy on the ground get invisible when you are in this form, so you cannot attack them, but still change to human to see them appear again which is (also again) very very laughable. Whats the point beeing a dragon if you cannot use your power anyway? It really sucks and looks like the games long back in the past of computer gaming. i wouldn't care if divinity2 was an indie game but it isn'tinstead it is a game i payd plenty of money for and all i get is a really bad state of quality (even worse than my english and thats very bad)So i got to the point i stopped playing the game cause i get to bored to play furthermore. I get stucked in one of that billion monster fights and asked myself what my charakter had for a reason to do that. But then i knew what i had to do. Changing my charakter into a dragon and fly anway from this game that was only a waste of time. Cause thats what dragons do.. searching for a real challenge and they could not find it in Divinity 2 (and they also like to destroy things others then turrets and probably goblin hoods or demon flys) At the end there is not much to say. If you are new to Action-RP-Games you could probably like this game but i recommend others like baldurs gate 1+2, gothic and even oblivion (still the Monster system there sucks)",Pinguinsocke

The game has no story (not that it needs one) and has a short and boring arcade mode, that seems to be made just to please the lone players. You may even hate the game until you play with friends. There isn't a character roster, unlike other fighting games; Player 1 is yellow and Player 2 is orange. They have the exact same moves, so it's your color preference. The visuals have a retro flavor, but are really fluid, something that helps giving the game its own personality. Each match follows the same basic steps:1. The players start the battle on a ""screen"" of the stage selected. They have to kill the opponent in order to advance to the next screen at the left or right extreme of the screen (depending on the character selected)2. The killer runs through the screens until he reaches the final one. His objective is to reach its end in order to win the match. The killed, meanwhile, respawns in its way, and has to kill its opponent in order to be able to advance.3. If the killed manages to kill his opponent, he is now able to pass screens, while taking that privilege from its victim. He has to pass all the screens his enemy advanced and reach the end of his final screen. The match ends when one of them reaches the end of the ""final screen"".The game is just that. The thing is that the fighters have lots of moves in their arsenal. Alongside stabbing, they can jump to do a divekick and hopefully take their enemy's sword, can throw their sword for a one-hit-kill proyectile (with the punishment of being left with only punches if the attack is deflected) and much more techniques. The best part is that the game only uses two buttons and the d-pad, meaning that is really easy to learn, yet hard to master. It has lots of customizable options as well, and a tournament mode for up to 9 players. The best part is that matches are as entertaining to watch as they are to play. It also has online mode, but it doesn't work too well, and having your friends close and taunt each other is half the fun.

But it *is* a scam.Numenera was kickstarted four years ago, in March 2013. It promised to become Planescape: Torment spiritual successor, to be released in December 2014 and managed to achieve a number of stretch goals. It failed to deliver on each and every one of those.Let’s start from the end. Things that were promised include player stronghold, crafting system, an additional major city of M’ra Jolios Oasis, alternate exit from the Labyrinth to another part of the world… None of those are in the game.Then we have the release date, postponed over two years. One would assume that because of that game is a pinnacle of polish, runs smoothly and is bug-free. Nope. On a modern machine, having no problems running, for example, Rainbow Six: Siege at max details with optional hi-res textures from the DLC enabled in 80+ fps, Numenera’s framerate is somewhere between 30 and 50. There are multiple bugs, though thankfully nothing severe—some formatting codes in the text, sometimes you can’t turn off a pop-up and you’ll experience plenty of inventory problems, including multiplicating gear, selling things that cost you money (sic!), drag’n’drop not working… The game is fully playable, yes, but it makes you wonder what exactly programmers did with those extra two years, especially when they used preexisting game engine used in Pillars of Eternity, which didn’t have any of those problems…Finally, we should compare Numenera to the original Planescape. The predecessor was narrative-heavy game with seven fully-fledged followers with interesting stories; complicated, unique and weird world that was a joy to explore and interesting, philosophical overarching plot. Most of those things are still here—there’s a ton of beautifully written text, long dialogs full of interesting stories, the world has a rich lore that you can explore etc. However, one of the things that made Planescape so good and memorable were the followers. Here, you have six, but they are not nearly as interesting as Planescape’s ones. They have very little to say, which you can explore *with a single dialogue* plus occasional one-liner dropped here and there. Their quests are a joke—they can be as simple and short as one single dialogue, reveal next to no information about them and be a chore (Callistege’s and Rhin’s especially; I don’t want to go into the spoiler territory, but when one character returns to you with something that could be an epic tale, they just give you one sentence that amounts to “too much to tell, so I won’t tell anything”).The first one third of the game (part which you could see and explore in the beta) is great, full of life, interesting quests etc. For this part only, I’d give at least 8/10. Unfortunately, that’s the best that game has to offer and it’s all downhill from there. Locations are rushed, NPC have next to nothing to say, quest quickly devour into “fetch me this thing from two locations from here, that’s not even heavily guarded”. And then there is the ending, which boils down to “here is the list of all possible outcomes, choose the one you like the most, done”. Nothing you did before that matters but for a quick recap in the epilogue.The game at this point is not worth its price. It’s not that long (it took me 20 hours to beat with *all* sidequests, but I read quickly and that is the most limiting factor; conversely, original Planescape was almost twice as long), quite bugged and not that fun overall. If you like reading in your games, you’ll like it, it is really well written. It just doesn’t feel too much like a game and I feel really sold short on the promises the developer made.",Althorion

You always play two characters at the same time and you need to time everything that you are doing in order for both of them to survive the level. However, their paths are not always symmetrical, so this is when your desynchronization skills will come in handy.The artstyle is gorgeous, and the overall presentation of the game is charming. The music and the voice-acting are also incredible. Hoebear the Metabear is hilarious, nagging you about getting achievements and the principle of playing games just for fun instead of for the score. It's a beautiful game, there is no other way to say it.It's one of those games where it's easy to play, but very hard to master and unlock everything.Pros:- Incredibly addictive gameplay- Awesome soundtrack- Hilarious voice-acting- Challenging and rewardingCons:- Sometimes TOO challenging- No quick reset button (trust me, you'll want that, and it's a shame that it's nowhere to be found)",TheMaxWall

It uses every single pixel on screen to mesmerize you and astonish you as to how much emotion can be portrayed using a 16 bit look. The story takes the supreme precedence in this adventure/RPG game (though there is almost no RPG elements- apart from a very humorous jab at jRPG early in the game). The creator uses the game mostly to paint a wonderful story surrounding love, adventure, life and death. Some might not like it since gameplay takes the back seat, but I assure you that this is the kind of game which makes most of the movies and tv shows look petty. While the gameplay elements are pretty straightforward for anyone to pickup quickly, there are some small challenges along the way concerning the number of moves to complete intermittent  puzzles.The game does falter a little bit towards the end, making use of tedious chasing sequences at one point but that is small enough to be forgiven.All in all this is a game which raises indie gaming to a whole different level in terms of its storytelling and the thoughtfulness of its premise- I might say as good as Braid and Limbo.Do yourself a favor and play this game.",avinashpathak60

1956,Slime-san: Superslime Edition,PlayStation4,9,"Since Super Meat Boy hit the scene, a series of difficult platformers with short levels have been released in the hopes of hitting the same levels of success. While Celeste has certainly reached that level, other games like Octahedron changed things up but didn’t appeal to everyone, even though we enjoyed it. A developer can’t blatantly rip off the base and expect the same kind of successSince Super Meat Boy hit the scene, a series of difficult platformers with short levels have been released in the hopes of hitting the same levels of success. While Celeste has certainly reached that level, other games like Octahedron changed things up but didn’t appeal to everyone, even though we enjoyed it. A developer can’t blatantly rip off the base and expect the same kind of success without adding their style to it, and that flare is where a game may live or die.Slime-san: Superslime Edition is what you loved about the original version of the game plus more. It has all the extras that you can unlock, the three campaigns, and several extra levels to bust your thumbs on. Quite honestly, the amount of content in this game is staggering. The levels themselves offer a decent amount of replay value with speed runs, extra challenge items, and secret areas. You can use the items from the secret areas (coins) and levels (apples) to purchase extra content, such as arcades and game filters, respectively. The arcade games are actually mini-games like kart racing, all of which stand out being a completely different look from the game you were just playing. These extras serve as an incentive to collect the apples and coins when you can, or at least gives players a reason to go back to the levels later on in the hopes of getting everything.Just because a game has a lot doesn’t mean that it’s all good. Luckily, it appears that is the case here. Whether you’re traveling through the giant worm, kraken, or facing Sheeple in his new appointed role of villain, everything plays well and is fun to take on. At the end of a series of levels you’ll be faced with a boss, which doesn’t involve too much out of the ordinary on your end, but it is fun to see how they incorporate all the skills you’d normally use to pass through a level against a large foe.As this is a game that focuses heavily on twitch gameplay (not the streaming service, although it would make for a good game on the platform), it’s important that the controls are tight and responsive. Any lag can mean death and unending frustration, and I’m happy to say the main disappointment you’ll face here is your own lack of ability. In addition to the obvious moving around, jumping, and wall jumping, you’ll have the ability to dash and phase through green objects that would otherwise be solid. That all sounds pretty basic, but it’s when you see how the abilities interact with the levels that things really start to get interesting. When you take into account that the phase ability also slows down everything including yourself, it allows for some pinpoint action – or will result in an untimely death.If you think you’ll have the ability to spend time on each level, think again. After a short period the level will begin to fill up with stomach acid. In some levels, this is necessary for progression as it’ll change the make-up of the level. In most it’ll merely serve as a timer forcing you to hurry through the level. The only time this will really cause any issues is for some of the apples you’ll be collecting. While there seems to be a lot of variation in the levels in what you’re asked to do, the tasks can become repetitive. While SMB has distinctive levels one after another, you’ll start to see double while playing Slime-san. One thing that will stand out amongst the repitition is the soundtrack, which is absolutely stellar. Make sure you have the volume up for this one.It’s no wonder that Slime-san is getting a new edition after spending some time with it. There’s so much to love about it, and while it does have a few flaws, the positives far outweigh the negatives it has. If you’re big into platformers and missed this the first time around, I implore you to get slimy with the Super Slime Edition.",GBG_Jason

1964,Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony,PlayStation4,3,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This game is pretty much a 40 hours long version of case 2-3 (Turnabout Big Top) from the Ace Attorney series but with a terrible tryhard meta ending. Sharing the same problems as the infamous case: the lack of a coherent story, and characters that feel bland and stupid amidst mistimed nonsense comic relief. Let's break it down.A futuristic setting with a fresh theme of Lies vs. Truth. With all the hype built through the years that preceded the release, the expectations were high for this game. After two incredible main games, with interesting twists and (some) memorable characters, the start of a new saga unrelated to the Hope's Peak Arc fills everybody with hope and despair.Firstly, the new mechanics. The new minigames are not an improvement, they still feel somewhat the same from the previous games, not appealing but kinda nice to break the monotony of a tiring class trial. Perjury is an interesting concept, but it was poorly worked: the back routes could be interesting but are way too short to the point of feeling more like an easter egg than a feature; I also don't like the fact it isn't optional at some points. Debate Scrums are stupid, require no thinking and the fact you're always on the correct side is annoying. Panic Debates despite being more realistic are just chaotic in this game, most of the characters are just spouting gibberish while you're the one panicking trying to end it asap.Secondly, the common points. Some cases are fantastic, V3 has some of the best murders mysteries of the series; on the other hand, some are pretty streched, forced, and/or predictable (i.e. cases 2 and 3). Executions are decent, the usual weirdness is there. Monokuma feels off without the Despair vs. Hope fight being the focus. ""Junko"" is bad. Side character (Maki) is pretty good despite being somewhat generic and lackluster after Kirigiri and Chiaki. Rival (Kokichi) is way duller than appears, with a conflicting character development that results in him being outshined by Komaeda and even Togami.The game starts pretty strong, with a solid and surprising first case (if you finished the game you know that this case loses all its shine due to the deus ex machina randomly thrown in it). It's still early in the game, and it introduces new potentially interesting characters. The twist is exciting and shocking. The new theme is introduced coherently and somewhat well developed. Monokubs are downright annoying and unnecessary.On the Chapter 2 it starts to feel uneasy. At this point it's made clear that Gonta, Himiko, Kaito, Miu and Tenko are irrelevant, instead they'll be repetitive comic relief characters with annoying catchphrases and/or lack of real personality for the rest of the game. The ""How"" is predictable, and the case is able to ruin and kill the characters with the most potential.Chapter 3 is about an incestuous creepy crazy serial killer with dissociative identity disorder murdering two people outta nowhere for his dead sister that is actually himself. Sounds ludicrous, right? Yeah.  ""How"" and ""Who"" are obvious. Case is annoying, tries to have this mythical and eerie vibe. Just ends up being stupid.Chapter 4 is pretty good. The ""How"" is somewhat predictable, but the way the case progresses is really interesting. Here we get to see some real antagonism by Kokichi, which is way better than him just lying to stall the trial ""for fun"".Chapter 5 has an awesome trial, to me one of the best from all 3 main games. it has twists enough to make the player question their own sanity. ""Who"", ""How"" and ""Why"" are completely unpredictable and masterfully done. Kokichi's character development from the previous chapters is thrown outta the window. Here we see the effort that should've been put into the whole game.Chapter 6 is what we all know. In a rushed attempt to tie all the loose ends it ruins the first case, sh*ts over the already bad story to replace it with a bad 4th wall breaking """"plot"""" twist. No decent internal conflict, terrible mastermind, discards all development the game had built, etc.The ""story"" progression has no effort, it's just about collecting the vague Flashback Lights and comical events; the characters are just apathetic after the trials; the comic relief ends up being vulgar and mechanical. In the end, it does deliver what it intends: a bunch of uninteresting characters without any real talent, a washed-up charmless shallow reality show, a Bollywoodesque absurd story that gets a little too self-conscious, and Monokuma(s).Intentionally or not, this game is clearly an unpleasant satire of the own Danganronpa franchise. The fact people just seem to ignore this and love it blindly to feel better about wasting their money is one of the most uncomfortable aspects of this game to me. It mocks every player and every meta game, pointing out how oblivious this fanbase has grown.I'd say this game deserves a 53/100 to match its title, but that would be a lie",ExLight

But while Planet Robobot takes a lot from Triple Deluxe, it also throws in a few new ideas. The biggest one being the new Robobot Armor that Kirby can ride, which essentially replaces the Hypernova from Triple Deluxe. The Robobot Armor is capable of heavy damage on both enemies and even the environment in some cases and can also copy certain abilities of enemies. And I think it's an awesome feature. On top of normal puzzle rooms that the Kirby series is good with, the Robobot Armor opens up new ideas for new puzzles. However the Robobot Armor can only have a certain amount of abilities and they aren't as diverse as Kirby with said powers, but they are capable of solving unique puzzles. On the topic of copy abilities, the line up in this game is really great, mixing in the series staples such as Fire, Ice, Sword and Beam, adding in new ones such as ESP, Doctor and Poison and reviving some old abilities not seen in a long time, such as Jet, a revamped Smash ability and my personal second favorite of all time, Mirror. The world themes were pretty awesome as well and the added robotic appearance each world had made the areas look really nice. While the main game won't take that long (if you're really dedicated to it), the amount of stuff to do afterwards still makes up for it. The game still isn't that hard either, but the Kirby gameplay itself more than makes up for it in my opinion. So overall, I really loved this game. While generally easy, it's still a fantastic Kirby game with an awesome new feature, an amazing set of copy abilities and classic fun stuff to do when the story is all said and done.",SuperMatt777
1972,War Thunder,PC,6,"Great visuals, sound and the feel of planes. Battles are cinematic, intense, full of flak fire, planes burning and bomb explosions.Also the game is very well optimised so it runs great on lower end machines with reduced settings.  Mouse controls are just excellent, although some players complain that they're too good and make joysticks redundant in Arcade mode.Three realism modesGreat visuals, sound and the feel of planes. Battles are cinematic, intense, full of flak fire, planes burning and bomb explosions.Also the game is very well optimised so it runs great on lower end machines with reduced settings.  Mouse controls are just excellent, although some players complain that they're too good and make joysticks redundant in Arcade mode.Three realism modes  Arcade, Historical, and Full Realism will appeal to a very broad range of players. There are also single missions and campaigns (some of which you have to pay extra for..which is fine) but they net meagre rewards and are not worthwhile at the moment. And if you want to progress in War Thunder you really need to be earning those XP points...which brings me to the downsides.What stops me from giving it a positive score is what happens outside of battles, namely the progression and economy models. Although at first leveling up is a pretty quick affair, with each level it becomes more and more time consuming. It gets pretty bad, to the point where without paying for the game reaching maximum level in one nation will take you half a year. Some can live with that...but then there's the crew level problem. You can buy crew levels with real cash, all the way to the top, skipping that part of the grind entirely  which is borderline pay to win.Other aspects of the progression model are equally strange. Crew skills and their effect on plane performance are undocumented. You have 5-6 crews and each can qualify for a dozen planes on different levels which leads to heaps of confusion. You take a hangar of 5-6 planes into each battle, usualy they are at different tiers and some players tend to exploit this to get better matchmaking. Ah, yes, matchmaking....it doesn't work very well, mainly because it has to balance players bringing their tier 1 and tier 10 plane into the same battle.On top of everything else although the game just went on Steam and has all the aspects of an almost finished commercial product, the developer makes huge changes to the economy on the fly. You can sink a lot of money into the game and you never really know what you're getting, since the economy model can get dramatically overhauled at any time.I would strongly suggest giving it a try, the visuals and spectacular gameplay are things you really should experience. But don't stay too long or you may start to feel unwelcome. And think twice...no, think THRICE before opening your wallet.Fly safe!",HawkerHulk

After looking at a few YouTube videos of the first game, I was intrigued enough to purchase this game while on sale. I have had my 3ds since launch and I can comfortably say that this is already in my top 3 games for the 3ds. I have completed the first 5 lessons in the beginner section and I am addicted. I played for 6 hours straight the day I bought it and even dreamt about drawing that night! The lessons walk you through each picture and style, ensuring that you understand the techniques that are being delivered. I already feel like my skills have increased significantly and that I will be more inclined to start producing art again like I did when I was an early teen. Each lesson will utilize different styles and give you insight on some famous artists/pieces of work. Overall, I would highly recommend this game to any fan of art and anyone who would like to learn the basics or perfect their skills. I hope Nintendo continues to focus on these types of realistic interactive games, the video game industry needs intelligent games like these.A+",SiLeNt_HiLL
1979,Lumines II,PSP,6," Entertaining puzzle game, but not the best. Addictive but like any other puzzle. Great Disappointment: Game Sharing transfer a One Player Demo to the ot¡her PSP That's not game sharing for me.

1981,Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance,PC,10," Forged Alliance is a whole different game than Supreme Commander. The balance is much better - no more sitting in your base and building mass fabs for an hour! Map control becomes much more important because you need to control as many mass extractors as you can. Each faction has differences that definitely affect the way they're played. The campaign wasn't too bad, but this Forged Alliance is a whole different game than Supreme Commander.

Each faction has differences that definitely affect the way they're played. The campaign wasn't too bad, but this game is all about the multiplayer. The game is definitely more enjoyable with actual humans than with AIs. There is also less lag online, since your computer does not have to calculate all of the AIs. The game will take a bit of getting used to, but once you get into it, it's great. If your computer can run it, then you'll love it. (the recommended specs for the game are a bit low - you'll want to have a dual core and 2 gigs of RAM to run the game.) Also, if you have questions about the game, the official forums are a great place to come to. Just make sure you use grammar in your posts, or you won't be taken seriously.",ErtwyuE.

I will start with it's weaknesses, the game to a lot can be  a little too long; and I agree it does drag on, and to be honest the way the game is structured; it really could've ended when you finish each ""chapter"", and it indeed suprised me each time the game continued after each chapter ended, ""Chapter 3 felt forced at first to me at first, but I quickly grew to realized it had the most amazing and unique level design in the whole game.The gameplay I loved, but to alot of people will be a turnoff, simple but really unique platforming,  there are also no guns, mostly just throwing objects at enemies or using your light-bar for combat. Most of the side missions were unique, but half of it was very elementary; and ok, but sometimes a bland linear open world. Now I can't stop gushing at the positives for this game. It really literally utilizes every aspect of the controller, which I loved. The lightbar, motion control, touchpad (especially loved drawing) all formed a very fun and amazing experience I've never had before in gaming. Seeing your creation in the world is AMAZING, hearing your voice in the game is AMAZING!!! Wandering off course looking for secret boxes were fun. The platforming and gameplay really shines in chapter two and three, one of the most unique/fun platforming experiences I've ever had. The story was meh, but the ending to me was cute. To me, although it did seemed like chapter 1 was an huge tutorial, chapter 2 and 3 had amazing gameplay and platforming utilizing the ps4 controller. I also forgot to mention I love the papery world, it felt real and authentic, major points for creativity!!!To end, this is not an game for everyone (casual dude bro gamers), but for hardcore gamers and looking for something unique, this is an amazing experience. No one can play though this game and say it isn't cool, or an amazing experience.",sityoazzdown

The campaign and challeng  tracks are (most of the time) well thought out and flow well.But with all that said, it does have its fair share of design flaws and hiccups along the way, some more frustrating than others.For a few examples: the cars can feel very weightless at times, especially the buggy, which a lot of the time is more of a frustration than fun when having to play as the buggy. It honestly feels at times that the cars are made of Popsicle sticks with the formula one car out of the four, feeling the most grounded.The physics engine is far from well thought out. It's 2016 and you're telling me I can't hit over that little shrub or smash through that small wooden barrier? These cars are going hundreds or Km/M per hour and a shrub stops them dead in their tracks? Don't think so game. I recall my car sky rocketing into the air because I hit a shrub that was no more than half a foot in length. Things like this shouldn't be in a game in this day and age, .

Along with the seasons they added holidays, the ability to create your own holidays, a new gardening career with a new florist station to create bouquets of flowers, gift giving, scouts for teens and children, and a bunch of recreational activities like roller skating/ice skating, swings, water, mud, and snow ball fighting, kiddie pools for toddlers, and so on. One thing I'm very impressed by is the fact that each life stage has a lot of interactivity with this pack, from toddlers through elders, each life stage has options to enjoy this pack in one way or another.

1999,Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions,3DS,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Have to say, i went into this game with high hopes since i have played all of them up until Dream Team and....i was sorely disappointed.First off some good things :+Mush Badges were nerfed+Art is nice and vibrant.+The minimap on the touchscreen is just as good if not better than in the DS games+Some of the remixed songs are amazingly good.+Bowser's Minions is a pretty decent idea IN CONCEPT.+Starbeans Cafe was buffed (As in doesn't require 25, only 10 beans total for a coffee)+Level up stat bonuses were made into actually obtainable bonuses instead of a random wheel where you usually get +1-s when there are +4-s on the roulette. It now stops when you press it.--And now for the bad things :-Mush Badges were nerfed to oblivion, like holy hell did they overdo it. Yes they completely broke the game originally but now they completely broke the badges, into absolute uselessnes. By the time you get even the basic Mush Badge you can buy a TWICE as good badge from the shop! This is a case of over-nerfing something.-The artstyle while in some parts beautiful, sorely lacks the quirky personality and charm of the original game. Some of the visual, sight and slapstick gags just simply do NOT work like this.-The touchscreen UI for moves while helpful is a bit clunky at times.-No 3D whatsoever even though this is a 3DS game.And it's not like Pokémon Moon where the art would be taxing the console...-No swapping Mario and Luigi uness it's move-specific, i mean come on!-Some songs just do NOT sound as good as the original (Looking at you Teehee Valley and Popple.)-The above mentioned ""in concept"" part of Bowser's Minions only works in that context. In practice this side-gamemode feels a bit tacked on, tries to handwavingly explain a lot of nonexistent plotholes (like why E.Gadd made Starbeans Cafe, like we REALLY needed to know that...) while creating more, and the gameplay itself is rather primitive. Just mash together a few units (8-max per team) and watch them bash heads, and wait for a few semi-random QTE's to pop up.An interesting yet shallow side-mode.-No option to swap between the GBA and Remastered soundtrack, even though you CAN listen to the GBA original songs IN the sound player IN-GAME!-The rewards for putting in the effort to 100% the game is not only lackluster, it's absolutely INSULTING. While the ""turn enemy gained coins into beans"" for collecting 100% of the hidden beans sounds nice, it procs WAY TOO RARELY, and the reward of ""Swapping your Attack for your Speed"" for finding ALL 100% OF THE BLOCKS, which DON'T COUNT IF YOUR INVENTORY IS FULL is just downright *INEXCUSABLE*. I'm not even going to bother trying to go for the ""Dodge 800 enemy attacks"" reward after the absolute useless trash i got for ""1000 Excellent ratings when attacking"" The game basically taunts you in the Records menu on what you did and did not do, then spits in your face when you actually take the effort to DO what it asks you.All in all it's a decent game with a lot of odd, nonsensical design changes at times, and sorely lacking endgame. Basically your best gear will come from the ruined shop at the end of the game. Avoid 100%ing it, it's not worth it, but if you're looking to relive this GBA classic, it's worth it just for the story. , and i'm giving it a 6/10 ,",Andrevus

The game in question is called Super Mega Baseball 2 and I was really looking forward to it because I really enjoyed the first instalment of the series back in 2015 and it’s a game I still enjoy to this day. Thankfully Super Mega Baseball 2 includes what was good about the first game and in some ways it improves over the original game, which is great. The physics were good in the original game, but to my surprise they were even better here. Everything about the batting and fielding oozes realism and when everything is in full flow you end up having a very immersive and enjoyable experience. Another thing they get spot on is that they make the game accessible to all gamers and you can tweak the challenge to how you want to play. So if your playing with your children then they can gain an upper hand and make things more fair, so everybody can enjoy the gameplay. Despite them making things very accessible you will still however need to get used to the controls that have been implemented. Don’t get me wrong the controls aren’t bad by any means it’s just that they feel a little awkward at times and this awkwardness will affect how you play from time to time. Another problem the game also has is in regards to the AI. The AI can act peculiar at times and they don’t do things you expect them to do so the realism can suffer a bit because of this. Thankfully though this isn’t a major problem and you easily forget about this because the game is best enjoyed with real people. If you like playing online then you will be very pleased with the online offering that’s been included. Everything plays out really well and I didn’t suffer with any problems when playing the game online, which is great. The online components give the game even more replaybility and in terms of content the game has more than enough to keep you satisfied, so you won’t be getting bored anytime soon. One of my favourite things about the first game was the presentation side of things, and thankfully it’s even better here. Visually the game has a nice arcadey look to it and when you combine that with the nice sound design it ends up delivering more fun and enjoyment to you. At the end of the day if you’re a fan of baseball game’s then you will thoroughly enjoy what Super Mega Baseball 2 brings to the table. It manages to create a very realistic experience and it doesn’t suffer with many problems, so all you end up having with this game is an incredible amount of fun and I thoroughly recommend that you give it a try.",Xbox_Alive

Where MD could fall to being boring at times, CP keeps the bar throughout the experience.Firstly, story-wise it is entirely self-contained, with a whole set of new characters, and from my point of view, it's great. As I'm not a hardcore fan of the series and I didn't beat Human Revolution (got bored at some point and abandoned it), MD's plot at times didn't make a lot of sense to me and I probably didn't catch many references to the other games. CP, on the other hand, could easily serve as an entry point into the Deus Ex universe. The plot itself isn't too original, but it works well.But what I mainly enjoyed is the non-linearity that fully shows here. CP is finally a proper ""immersive sim"" experience that Deus Ex should be, much like Dishonored or Prey. You are basically placed in a quite sizeable sandbox with numerous sideways, vent shafts, corridors, etc., so there are always many ways of to complete your objective  There is also plenty of optional stuff, and exploration is well-rewarded - while you start off without any augs or equipment, by exploring the prison's corners you can eventually get your full arsenal back. Another welcome change is that there is much less emphasis placed on hacking things, as that mini-game got old pretty fast.From the downsides I'd note that this add-on is a bit buggy, as I experienced a couple of crashes while playing.Anyway, in my opinion, A Criminal Past is a great DLC that's a must-have for the owners of the original game.",RealMuthaF

This game is not focused entirely on loot, skills (although there's a wide variety), and other distracting (though important, I know) features. The game is all about the story. The developers intentionally put less loot into the game so that the player would not be distracted by superficial materials. The main character, Gerault, instead, grapples with challenging decisions during the course of the game. In most games today, it is a matter of good vs. evil (take Oblivion, Mass Effect, or Dragon Age for example), in which good usually prevails in a concrete, simple fashion. But, here we have a game where the line between good and evil is difficult to draw and define. You really need to analyze the plot to get a sense of Gerault's purpose in the game and whether his actions are good or bad. You might think that the main character is this nice guy that sets out to destory some evil nemesis (sadly the plotline of most games today), but you're really dealing with a much more complicated plot (which makes it interesting of course). Gerault commits wrongdoings like gambling, drinking, adultery, and etc. which shows how he is flawed despite his heroic deeds (he is indeed a tragic figure). I also found the ending very profound and philosophical. Unlike most video games, you'll actually find some insights into the human character. You'll question whether it is right to interfere with nature, and ask whether it's right to live in an ideal world. The quality of the artistry, dialogue, music, and gameplay is also very good. Overall, good game. At least give it a try. It will stick with you, I promise.",MarkO.

2018,Kentucky Route Zero - Act I,PC,5,"Kentucky Route Zero is certainly a memorable experience but I simply cannot overlook how absurdly expensive it is. It's a five-act game where the first act can be completed in an hour, and that's if you take your time and explore absolutely everything, so it would be reasonable to assume that you're paying 18 euros for five hours of gameplay and you don't even get all five hours at once.Kentucky Route Zero is certainly a memorable experience but I simply cannot overlook how absurdly expensive it is.

And I'm not sure if the term ""gameplay"" is even correct here since this is very much an interactive story and it's not obvious if your dialogue choices affect anything at all.

Going off of telltale I have not experienced any immersion breaking graphical glitches (unlike telltale games where you will have body parts/ weapons fading through clothing etc) and the game tries to keep it so that the information you need to remember is provided within each episode (with one exception), which is handy since the business model has the episodes coming out every 2 or so months. The time travel mechanics are also very fresh (and thus unclear) and makes me wonder at the possibilities for time travel in future games.The bad: Some have pointed out issues with lip syncing but I have not noticed, also there is one exception to what I previously stated in that you do need to remember how the time travel mechanics work (which isn't very clear in the first place) from previous episodes, for example there were two puzzles in episode 3 which had me stumped for a good 10-15 minutes each, the first puzzle relies on using time travel mechanics in an unconventional way that you may or may not figure out as the game doesn't tell you (or if it does I don't remember it telling me which is a fault in clarity and guiding the player as several others have experienced this problem). The second puzzle I can't really get into without spoiling, but it was a failure in terms of game design, but not one that relies on the time travel mechanics.The ugly: Now for the business model, I abhor this business model (the episodic business model) and is one of the oldest tricks in the book in terms of television, it makes you want the next episode encourages you constantly thinking about it throughout the weekly, month;y or yearly, release schedule. This is a common marketing ploy used to keep you thinking about a product and is very effective in making you want more. However I am still willing to give this game a 10, which I suppose speaks to its effectiveness.TL:DNR Great game, while not a ""game changer"", like games such as Telltales the Walking Dead, it is still one of the finest examples of the genre and of storytelling in video games.",EABanBoy

2025,Gunslugs,PlayStationVita,4,"Retro styled graphics, solid chiptune soundtrack, quick playability, and an attractive price point might convince you (as it did me) this is worth picking up.  Unfortunately, you're likely to bump your head when you dive into this very shallow pool.What starts off as a fun run-and-gun roguelike quickly devolves into a repetitive bullet hell slog as you hold down the directional buttonRetro styled graphics, solid chiptune soundtrack, quick playability, and an attractive price point might convince you (as it did me) this is worth picking up.  Unfortunately, you're likely to bump your head when you dive into this very shallow pool.What starts off as a fun run-and-gun roguelike quickly devolves into a repetitive bullet hell slog as you hold down the directional button to run (and shoot) right.  It's as straight forward as you can get as you move from level to level completing the same objectives with nothing more than a slight change in background color and an occasional new enemy.   Enemies constantly spawn from both directions and fill the screen with unavoidable damage and projectiles which keeps you running from health kit to health kit instead of trying to skillfully accumulate a high score.  Run, shoot, run, shoot, jump, shoot, die, repeat.Games that are known for their difficulty (like Spelunky and Dark/Demon Souls) offer rich and deep game systems that take time to learn, but once learned, become master-able and elevate the experience.  A game that kills you by spawning 3 land-floating mine combos in a row isn't ""difficult"" it's just cheap.  And that's a hard example; it seemed like the majority of deaths came from situations that were completely out of my control or from sloppy mechanics.  Considering the structure of the game changes very little from start to finish (and tends to drag), dying for seemingly no reason makes re-starting less and less appealing each time.There are some roguelike styled rooms that are placed in missions but after a short while you'll see the majority of what the game has to offer and see the same ""random"" events with enough consistency you'll know what to expect.  There are also a good deal of mission ""objectives"" which adds some incentive to keep playing but they are most often too simple or out of reach for far too long.Overall, a very mediocre experience that manages to be too frustrating to be bland.  It's extremely low price-point won't hang over your head for too long, but when compared to say, Super Crate Box (a game that does everything Gunslugs does better and only $1.50 more), it's hard to recommend.",option1live
2026,Jade Empire: Special Edition,PC,9," A fantastic game. After playing Mass Effect, I went out and bought every BioWare game I could find, including Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire, simply because I couldn't afford to have missed these brilliant games at the prices they are being sold for now. Having a strong interest in Chinese history, Jade Empire appealed to me immediately. As with Mass Effect, Jack Wall A fantastic game. After playing Mass Effect, I went out and bought every BioWare game I could find, including Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire, simply because I couldn't afford to have missed these brilliant games at the prices they are being sold for now. Having a strong interest in Chinese history, Jade Empire appealed to me immediately. As with Mass Effect, Jack Wall has produced another hit-and-miss soundtrack, with slow, drab tracks followed by thunderous, spectacular masterpieces. The yu pipes and taiko drums prove to be the saving grace here, and the Ancient China-based theme of Jade Empire certainly benefits from their presence. The graphics, whilst not brilliant, are more than adequate. I did, however, play the ""Special Edition"" PC version, which has been obviously heavily modified as opposed to its Xbox counterpart, so my perspective may be somewhat skewed. I found the characters enjoyable, with vibrant colours and intricate clothing designs making them all the more appealing. I was surprised to read that my personal choice of character, Monk Zeng, was not even in the original release of the game! Good thing then that BioWare had the presence of mind to return him to the cast for the Special Edition release. Voice acting is above average, which is always a plus with a dialogue-heavy RPG, and there are familiar voices involved. I believe I even heard Nathan Fillion in there, whom I had no idea did voice acting for games. There were also no bugs, crashes or sudden errors of any kind here, which plagued my experience when playing through both of the KotOR titles. On the negative, I found Jade Empire's one and only major flaw to be the combat system, which was far too basic. The AI was not particularly brilliant and the combat move sets for each style were very limited. This alone strikes one point from my final score. Nevertheless, if you enjoy BioWare's other renowned high standard RPGs like KotOR, you should certainly not miss this game. For $10 (Australian), there's really no excuse.",C.J.

Asherons Call was and I think still is the best RPG game ever made.The entire game was a free roaming world of exploration. Sure at level 1 rabbits could kill you, but with enough cunning and care you could actually traverse the forests between towns by tip toeing around the edges of banderling camps! I remember the excitement and fear of edging past, hoping I wouldn't alert the nasty creature 30 levels higher than me.You could play your character in entirely your own way. You weren't restricted to pre-conceived classes like mordern RPGs  if you wanted to be a dagger wielding melee mage relying on magical shielding to help you last you could do just that. Every kill would give you xp  and skill points. No waiting to level to spend your meager advancement. Your character scaled as you played  real time. Finish a kill? Spend a point on melee defence for a few more dodges.I remember the first day creating a character and portalling into Holtburg. The community was buzzing, warm, open and friendly. Nothing like the level rushing, item hoarding online games of today. Many hours were spent just sitting in town chatting.If you didn't want to be part of a guild or community that was fine too. You could explore, survive and live in the wilderness all on your own. Finding swirling pink portals to dangerous dungeons filled with creative and interesting tunnels to explore. Some of the dungeons were so deep and dangerous that you were suddenly reminded; I ran 35 minutes to find this place. I am in the middle of nowhere. And I am alone.... If I die, I will reappear back at the damn lifestone I linked to in town.There were also the popular dungeons, crammed with other players. Backs to the wall to make full use of the shielding mechanics as the Lugians would pile in around you, blocking all escape. Better hope you don't fail on your first aid skill as wave after wave of carnage comes barreling in. Some fool unknowingly taunts a whole room and runs for his life past your corner of solace bringing in a whole new wave of death. How terrible was it to die, leaving a treasured item on your corpse deep deep within a dungeon. Would you risk travelling all the way back inside to retrieve it.... if you die, you might lose another item!Months spent hunting golems to collect pyreal motes  questing to a volcanic forge to finally craft them into a legendary atlan weapon. Then spending more months questing for the elemental stones to empower your atlan even further... Not to mention shadow armor, mattecor coats or finally completing my mages armor set! :)I only have positives to say about this game.

This is like another Bioshock or actually more like Half-Life 2 to me, I could see myself playing through this game multiple times. It is a masterpiece really, it is a game about atmosphere and story and I personally found no issues with the ballistics. Shooting was fun, the game is challenging, and has a very, very good story (based of the book of the same name.) Best graphics of any game released. Yes, better than Crysis, in it's full glory with DX11 it looks spectacular. The game just has this authentic, realistic feeling and the graphics just add a whole nother layer onto the game. I REALLY felt like I was there in this world, extremely compelling. Must play! 10/10 Will be a cult-hit, possible the most under-rated game of the year.",PabloN

Of course, the series ia also fun to play and great to follow, with a roster of unforgettable characters...and villains too. The game plays as a mix of an adventure game and...sort of quiz game...I think. I have no proper words but the point is that both parts mix very well and they are both fun to play, especially since the story (or stories) behind the game are well thought and will make you think of how to solve the cases. Honestly, my big complains is that out of 5 missions, 2 are rather short and very simple, almost kid-friendly (the first case is literally a tutorial case, while the second is almost impossible to lose). From case 3, the game ramps up in difficulty and become a lot more enjoyable, and the last 2 cases are probably THE single best cases of the entire series (Trial and Tribulation cases are close...but only these are remarkable at their best). Graphics are simple and clean (and oldish, since I heard it was from a Gameboy Advance game), but funcional, and...I really have nothing else to mention, because the flaws are almost non-existants. Maybe the game should have had more endings, and maybe the game should have been more open (you won't go forward until you trigger the right event, which is either the discover of an item, talking to a person, or showing items to a person). Except these, I have almost no complains at all, since it's also very long to play (I think it's gonna last you at least 10 hours, but there's no counter). One of the strongest adventure game on the DS, and possibly one of the best games of the console: must at least try once but if you love adventure game, it' s an instant purchase.",vahn

And this one will stay with you as well. While we explored more of a 'love' theme in ""To The Moon"", ""Finding Paradise"" touches more on regrets, loneliness and growing up. And yes... someone will be cutting onions again towards the end. Even though I guessed it this time, I am still going to say it didn't disappoint.The soundtrack is where the game shines as well. It's a masterpiece by itself and I will listen to it once it is released. Just to give you an idea how great it is - I deliberately stayed longer in some rooms, just so I can enjoy the music.

In comparison, the huge amount of side quests in Amalur naturally make the main quest feel sluggish.

Enemies follow the same route, being re-imagined classic creatures like kobolds and brownies. Overall disappointing, but still very bearable.COMBAT is visceral and fun, and while not nearly as difficult as current ""hardcore"" rpgs like Witcher 2 and Demon's Souls, it does take some concentration. Unfortunately some difficulty is given by combat animations delaying your block and roll, something the above games suffer from much less.GRAPHICS are vibrant and sharp, but overall very cartoonish. Depending on the person this could be one of the greatest features or biggest detriments, and I'm so-so on them. They don't have the realism and grit of Witcher 2's graphics, but are well done in their own right. Lighting is well used and there are some really great environments to admire.THE USER INTERFACE is a tiny bit clunky and bare, but still way better than Skyrim's launch.MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS include the camera, which I personally like but many find a problem with, mainly due to its floaty nature and fixed view distance. Character creation was pretty limited. My personal biggest was the lack of player voice overs, which really detracts from conversations. ALL IN ALL, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning gets a 7/10.

Also many of the puzzles in act 2 didn't make much sense and were a total clickfest.  Its a real shame, because the creative artwork is gorgeous and the original concept seemed to have so much promise in the first act.  It was especially refreshing to have such a cute and colorful world to interact with in contrast to all the mature and violent game worlds nowadays.

I've been playing it a great deal since getting my hands on it and for the first time since I can remember that I've invested in a new IP and ended up with exactly what I was expecting. Rage delivers on almost every level.I don't need to get into Rage's graphics or presentation; one look at the game speaks for itself in case you haven't heard id's ongoing rambling about it being one of the best looking games available. id Tech 5 shows off enough power here to impress any reasonable person. That being said, I'm playing Rage on the PS3 (that installation time was a **** and the only graphical flaws are minor but similar to those I've seen in Killzone 3 and Crysis 2. I considered getting this game for the 360 but I was turned off by the need for having to install three discs. I have the 250-GB slim model, but as someone who once had the old (and very limited) 20-GB 360, I feel the pain of those who won't have the hard drive space to install all three at once.Audio design is just as well done in every aspect one would expect, but I'll leave it up to you to discover how great it is rather than going into detail here.My only legitimate complaint thus far is that the checkpoint system in Rage is basically non-existent. You'll receive auto-saves at the beginning of and just after missions, but that's it. Traveling through one of the game's lengthy city stages and being sent back to outside the city walls upon death was frustrating enough for me to put the game down for a while. I've experienced this type of setback a few times already. This is solved simply enough by saving the game whenever it comes to mind, but I'm generally more focused on trying to immerse myself in the world and the action around me to worry about a feature that's standard in most games nowadays.Also, it's worthy of a small note that this is not Shakespeare. Rage has a plot, and as some of it's elements aren't exactly new and exciting, (we've all walked out of a vault, scrounged to stay alive, and spent many hours in futuristic wastelands), the player shouldn't expect a groundbreaking narrative from id Software. I was let down by this, as I hoped Rage would be a rift in the trend of shooters with poor stories. It's not a bad plot, it's just kind of there to get you from A to B.Other than my minor gripes, Rage is everything I wanted.Enemies are just as brutal and resourceful as we've heard, as Rage features some of the best enemy AI I've ever seen. Mutant thugs dodge your reticule when you go ADS, downed foes crawl to cover as they bleed out, etc. I've already been forced to do some encounters twice (see ****y paragraph above) and can confidently say that other than perhaps boss battles, no two encounters in Rage will ever be the same.The arsenal available to the player is also impressive, if not comprised of elements that have been done before. Four weapons can be hot-mapped to the right trigger/R2 menu, with additional weapons available in the game's in-depth and useful Inventory system. Two assault rifles, two shotguns, a pistol, a sniper rifle, a rocket launcher, and yes, a crossbow, are among the main tools that deal out very convincing damage to opponents. Each weapon has various firing modes and ammunition types. Coupled with Rage's stellar opponents, mixing weapons, ammo types, and equipment is what makes the combat fun. It's very much the player's game, and it generally rewards creativity with success in combat.Driving across the wasteland has been surprisingly fun and deep to this point. It easily outdoes the fragile and clunky controls of the go-karts in Borderlands. Vehicles are waiting to be unlocked, their weapons upgraded, their bodies painted, and bonus powers are available to turn the odds on the bandits who always outnumber the player.id obviously has a lot of faith in their vision for Rage's vehicular combat. Races and unlocking new vehicles are key components of progressing in the campaign. Also, traditional FPS multiplayer components have been scrapped and replaced by Twisted Metal-like car combat. It's not a venue of endless entertainment, but it is a fun break from traditional shooters and is much deeper than most will be expecting.I firmly believe that reviews have been unfair to Rage. This is, in my opinion, a perfect example of a game that is fun despite some abstract number some critic picked out. The presentation is gorgeous, the gameplay is tight but expansive fun, and this game does just enough right to warrant a return to the all-too-familiar apocalypse setting.Rage isn't a masterpiece; it's a vision.",Andruson

My disappointment comes when I go from the strategy turn based part of the game to the real time battles. there is a glitch where the game runs intermittent while loading the battle. It can take 5-10 minutes to load up a battle on my computer. My computer is a brand new Alienware aurora with upgraded graphics. It's definitely not a slow or under powered computer. I think it's a game flaw. It will also freeze up every now when going to a real time battle. Other than that the gameplay is great and smooth at full graphics. The other thing I like is the time frame for each turn, two weeks. It's great and much more realistic than previous total war games. That adds so much to the game for me and the reason I rate the game higher than I would with my loading problem. If it weren't for the battle loading problem I would give this game a 9....",roberts
2084,Overlord,PC,9,"In my opinion, Overlord is one of the funniest games out there to this day.

On top of that, this game has superb writing and an excellent plot, which takes your character through each of the seven deadly sins.  Each of the environments you play through is greatly unique, with its own additional unique set of characters.What's really odd about this game, is that it is a complete satire on the stereotypical fantasy game, and as such uses about as many stereotypes for its various characters as possible.  But in the end, Overlord stands out as an extremely unique game, and a superbly unique fantasy.  It is amazing how it can do both at the same time.  Overall, I greatly enjoyed this game, and it was well worth the $20.00 I bought it with from steam a couple years back.  (It's probably much cheaper now.)  To this day, it's still greatly enjoyable.",Duderoth

I always found myself retreating though because I had the wrong cards or suffered a bad dice roll. Constantly on the defensive. With only 3 people on your squad its hard to formulate any effective strategy. Every map you are outnumbered 3 - 1 if not more. There is no skill/card to remove status ailments. There is no skill/card to revive a fallen team mate either. So if somebody on your team dies... too bad. If you are stuck with something like bind or bleed... better learn to enjoy it.The maps are bland and small and you are constantly surrounded and dead in no time. The only real tactic you have is the 'backstab'. But your opponent is going for the same move.I also found myself fighting the camera. It kept zooming in automatically when the opposition was making a move or taking some action. I don't care! Why are you zooming in? You also fight the map just to try to get a clear view of things as buildings and other objects are in your way.In the end... not what I was hoping for.

It's still usable most of the time, unlike some other 3DS games that have been released so far. Everyone who owns a 3DS should buy this game because it really is that fun.

Thankfully the game delivered in all areas and I would go as far to say that it’s better than the first game, which I didn’t think they would be able to do. The world in the game feels alive from the get go and it has so many things for you to do that you’ll be sinking hours and hours into the game. The story accompanying these hours of gameplay is fantastic and the best thing is that they keep things gripping and interesting throughout. The combat in the game is better than the first game in my opinion, and the main reason for that is because it just gives you more of a satisfied feeling. I was also very impressed with the skills and abilities that presented themselves and the game definitely gives you a rewarding feeling, which in turn makes you want to sink even more hours into it. The battles in the game have you sweating and keep you on the edge of the seat at all times, and I must admit that I’ve never had so much fun being in a battle on a game. The presentation side of the game makes Shadow of War stand out even more, and that’s because the visuals and sound design make you become even more immersed in the game. At the end of the day fans of the first game will fall in love with this game almost immediately. They’ve kept everything that was good from the first game and in some cases they’ve improved in some areas, which is absolutely fantastic. What really stands out in the game though is not once did I get bored when playing, and that’s amazing because I’ve sunk in a massive amount of hours. Without a shadow of a doubt Middle-earth: Shadow of War is one of the best game’s I’ve played this year and I can see the game being up for a number of awards.",Xbox_Alive

It had a uniqueness about it that was quite profound and it was a game that I followed quite closely until its release. When it did release to say I had a very enjoyable time with the game would be a massive understatement and it ended up being one of my favourite games of 2016. I enjoyed it so much that I was really hoping for a sequel and that wish was granted with the surprise release of Unravel Two at this year’s E3. Sequels aren’t often as good as the original game but this is different with Unravel Two because in some ways it’s better than the first game. Unravel Two has thrown a unique idea into the mix over the original and that is co-op. When played with a friend this game is absolutely flawless but don’t let that stop you playing on your own because it still delivers a lot of enjoyment when playing the game this way. Once again you will see a lot of platforming elements and puzzles included like the original and in a way these aspects are better this time around. The puzzles have more creativity in this game in my opinion and when you complete them with a friend you get a very satisfying feeling. Platforming in this game is absolutely flawless and on the whole the technical side of the game holds up extremely well throughout your time with the game. Thankfully the controls that have been implemented also hold up extremely well throughout as well and everything remained fluid and responsive at all times and not once did I come across any problems. One thing that really surprised me about Unravel Two was the amount of content it has. I wasn’t expecting there to be this much content avaliable and to say this game will keep you satisfied for quite a few hours would be quite the understatement. Despite the huge amount of content available I still would’ve liked to have had a little more content when it came to the game’s story though, but this is only a minor gripe and in fact this is my only gripe full stop which shows just how good the game is. Without a doubt one of my favourite things about the first game was its presentation and I’m pleased to say it’s also one of my most favourite things about this game as well. Visually the game looks absolutely stunning and when you combine the visuals with the fantastic sound design you end up having a very immersive experience. At the end of the day as far as sequels are concerned Unravel Two is definitely up there with some of the best sequels of all time. It’s took what was good from the first game and improved it quite considerably and to say this game gets a big thumbs up from me would be a massive understatement.",Xbox_Alive

Controls are smooth as silk, very easy to start stop/reverse, boost , and of course do tricks,including flips etc. Whether you are on the ground or in the air, all movements can be handled with a pro level of precision. Aside from the obvious smashing into a wall, the only mechanic in the game that puts you at a slight risk of failure is the occasional ""balancing act"", having to keep from leaning too far foward or back, but those of you who have played any Tony Hawk game are already familiar with this. The games music scores sound just like a cheesy 80s action movie (or like you are on the set of one). But there's a certain undeniable charm within that cheesiness.With the exception of crash & burn, pretty much everything you do earns you bonus points. Tricks and combos earns you bonus points and build up your boost meter, and speed earns you an even higher bonus. Keep landing flawless runs to add to your bonus multiplier and blow everybody in the leaderboads out the water!Adding to the already high replay value & customization options is the ""Movie Maker"" which allows you to create,edit and share your own stages with other players as well as play your creations yourself!Good: Graphics,various choices of costumes/characters,fluid controls,replay value, tons of bonus content.Bad: in certain situations/vehicles you can lose balance easily if you land awkwardly or lean too far.GAMEPLAY - 8BUCK'S WORTH - 9EFFECTS - 9CONTENT - 8Verdict: Joe Danger is the perfect mixture of platform adventure and arcade racing action. And as far as sequels go, the folks at Hello Games did an excellent job.",Psvitalife

It has an excellent learning curve with a few potential difficultly spikes depending on your skill level, but feels that much more rewarding once the player has overcome such obstacles. The dialog is also something to mention as it is quite funny most of the time by either making old movie references or breaking the forth wall. After the Campaign, multiplayer is where you'll refine your skills either locally, online normal/ranked or asynchronously(play by mail basically). Async is particularly nice if you happen to have a windows phone or windows 8 tablet as it lets you play one turn and send it to your opponent, then come back hours later to see how your opponent responded to your actions.With 30+ multiplayer maps specifically design(and well balanced so far) between 2, 3 and 4 players, there's a ton of game for just $15.

Perhaps i'm just done with the game altogether but lack of originality is really something that comes to my mind in every area when it comes to BFA.I find BFA lacking in content. Compared to legion, the story is very weak and hardy even believable (I know it's a fantasy world but still). Blizzard over-promises and delivers very little content. At the moment, there is not much to do and features like island expeditions which were heavily advertise, disappoint.One can do dungeons but the time-gating on blizzard's side is really visible here. Warfronts, raids and mythic+ dungeons are coming, allied races as well. It is clear for me that this expansion focused on player retention and moneymaking mechanics rather than something original. Something created not out of heart but in a corporate conference room.I really have problems with game mechanics at 120. Players can do world quests or farm azerite power. Thing I've done in excess during the last expansion. They are straight up revolting for me and are nothing more than time-wasters put in place just to engage players in meaningless activities. I feel restricted like I'm getting some fun, just to stay and play but not enough to be really satisfied.Writing in WoW has never been great but I feel like it is stagnating. C'mon blizzard, your players age. The game is almost 15 years old but the story is written for teenagers and very young at best. Characters are one-dimensional and their actions illogical. Maybe I'm just looking for a more mature story after we've all seen fantasy world created in eg. GoT.The good thing are the visuals. It's astounding what can be done with such an old engine. I've only done the horde part but voldun is one of the best looking zones in the game, especially at the night. This is probably what designers envisioned for Tanaris or Uldum.It's really hard for me to say 'don't buy it'. I personally feel like bfa does not changes enough. Yet, it is still good ol' WoW. Dungeons are fine, the raids will probably be as well. Classes play mostly like they have in Legion. I expected a different direction.",Napieracz

Instead of simply using the highest skilled PC automatically - you'll have to select him, select the skill, select the object. Might not be an issue the first hundred times, but it gets bore-some as you have to drudge through ever container you can find to stock up and that means using perception, trap/alarm disarm, lock pick/electronic/safe crack and that's likely spread out over multiple characters. Something that was fine in the 90s and 00s, but even though it's an ""old school RPG"" we do not need all ""old school mechanics"". Polish and quality of life features came into existence for a reason.The dialogue, and levelling up system is also a bit annoying and again - it gets tiresome because you have to do it over and over and over.Character creation is what creation is, but the models used aren't that ""pretty"", so if that's your thing - then it'll cost on the score. It's not for me, so I'm fine with it - but again, I can't help but think that it's 2014 and not 1994. Even if it is a kickstarter game.But the game does have that nice ""wasteland"" feeling, combat and questing is otherwise acceptable, and even though bugs exists - I've not found any to be gamebreaking (yet).So as mentioned - if the likes of Fallout 1, 2 and/or Tactics grapped you back then - you're likely to enjoy this game, but a masterpiece of score 10 it is not.7 to 8 because is feels and plays as a solid game. I'm properly leaning a bit more towards 7 than 8 now after having played some more hours because the lack of polish is a grinding factor.",Alsvha

Its almost like a moving water color painting and fans of Japanese style artwork (myself included) will be greatly pleased by this game's aesthetics.   This is the best looking 2d game I'veMuramasa: The Demon Blade is one of the best games on the wii, and a thoroughly underrated title.  First off, and obviously as everybody has stated before, the game's visual presentation is stunning.  Its almost like a moving water color painting and fans of Japanese style artwork (myself included) will be greatly pleased by this game's aesthetics.   This is the best looking 2d game I've ever seen (maybe bar Rayman origins.)   But, as I've always said, , I choose the games I like much like the women I like, for their gameplay, not their graphics.  Sure at its core, Muramasa is a 2d, side scrolling hack and slash adventure game with platforming and rpg elements, the RPG elements making this game much deeper than just a run of the mill hack and slasher.  There's a fun cooking mechanic that requires learning recipes from books and collecting the ingredients to make food that increases your stats and health, as well as a crafting system to make your own blades.  These elements, while adding to the depth of the game overall, may not be deep enough for hardcore rpg gamers.  Of course, as with any hack and slash game, it runs the risk of becoming repetitive and stale.  And while the combat isn't varied in and of itself, it never became a chore to play because the combos are fluid, and satisfying to pull off, as well as each blade having its own unique powers and strengths.  There is also enough variation in enemies, each having different strategies you will need to figure out to dispatch them easily.  Boss battles are long, epic, challenging and satisfying.   The story and characters are strong, based on classic Japanese culture, and the soundtrack is beautiful and matches the games tone well.   As far as criticism goes, I do have a few things.  One being that while the backgrounds are gorgeous, they do tend to repeat themselves A LOT.  There are different backdrops for different parts of the world in each area obviously, but what I mean is for example there is one area where you are in a town setting.  The first background you see in that setting will be the one you will see until the area changes (In this case fields of beautiful cherry trees.) This is really a shame seeing as how stunning the art design is, I really wish they would have had 5 or 6 backdrops per area instead of just two or three.  This repetition in scenery is only compounded by the enormous amount of backtracking that is required of you in this game.  Every time you beat a boss, you have to backtrack all the way to the energy field that was blocking your way to get to the next area, that you can now access with the blade you've just acquired.  This game needed some sort of fast travel or hub world system where you could quickly go from one place to another, because this is not a hardcore enough RPG that you will enjoy grinding in battles for exp.  My last complaint is that, as I touched on before, I feel like the rpg elements in this game could have been fleshed out more, which leaves them feeling like sort of an afterthought.  Overall, this game is an amazing 2d sidescroller that has all of its elements come together beautifully to make it greater than the sum of its parts.

There are other game modes such as 'Puzzle' (in which you have to solve puzzles to eliminate all the cards on the board), timed mode, and multiplayer. The Trial Game gives you a good idea of what you're getting, so give it a try. I'm definitely putting this one up there with Lumines and Hexic HD.",Sean

One of the biggest challenges in galciv2 was to balance production, economy, research and approval. Well in galciv3 economy is stupid easy to maintain. Its trivial to maintain positive income even with no economic improvements on planets. Further, production seems to the king of all resources in this game as you can convert production to other types resources (like money or research as you could in Galciv2) but you can increase production much more easily than the other two and you can set up production based planets almost 3-4 times as fast. Since there are so many ways to amplify production, you can easily have a planet with 2x-3x as much production than any other possible resource with their bonus buildings. As a result, my main production center almost always acts as my best research planets (same for money but I never need money in this game)... very disappointing when you consider how much longer it takes to build research planets, one would think there should be a reward for it but nope, you are better off making all production and converting to research.My only other gripe is the AI. It seems to me that the AI cheats in higher difficulties rather than playing by the rules. I am not sure if Galciv2 was that way but I dont like that because it cheapens a win and a loss does not really feel like a loss since I know the AI is cheating.Overall a good game despite the above gripes. Much of the old game is in Galciv3 but I really did not think that any of the new additions made the game any better. I think Galciv2 is a better game.",Mar-77
2156,Stories Untold,PC,5,"Stories Untold is a rather odd game from Devolver Digital, which seems to sort of be their thing. At first, it appears to be some sort of weird text adventure thing, though in a “game within a game” sort of environment, as you are playing the game on a computer on a desk inside your computer.The game has a very 1980s vibe to it, which isn’t surprising, because it is set in 1986. ItStories Untold is a rather odd game from Devolver Digital, which seems to sort of be their thing. At first, it appears to be some sort of weird text adventure thing, though in a “game within a game” sort of environment, as you are playing the game on a computer on a desk inside your computer.The game has a very 1980s vibe to it, which isn’t surprising, because it is set in 1986. It reminds me somewhat of the 1980s Twilight Zone, or similar shows; the first story immediately makes you realize that the game is going to be rather meta, but the game has a number of additional twists in store as you go through its four episodes.That being said, I use the term “game” somewhat loosely here; this is a strictly linear storytelling experience, and is almost entirely concerned with following directions rather than solving puzzles or interacting with the environment in any sort of meaningful way. Rather, this is more like an interactive made-for-TV movie, or perhaps miniseries – and it is about as long as one, too, clocking in at about 2 hours and 15 minutes to complete.While this seems to be a horror game at first, it is not the “random monster jumps out and scares you” kind of horror, and while the first episode does a reasonable job of messing with you, the later ones become much less creepy, though all of them have at least somewhat worrisome aesthetics to them.As the game goes on, increasingly more gameplay mechanics are added, and while the game never becomes complex, and you never really do much more than follow directions, the extremely limited adventure game interface is actually limited to only a couple portions of the game.All that being said, this is a very, very simple game. While this is not a walking simulator, this is still a very narrative-focused game with very little actual gameplay, perhaps more like a visual novel than anything else, though its interface is, if anything, most reminiscent of Don’t Touch Anything in terms of being in a very narrowly confined space most of the time, with just one or two screens of actual “content” per episode (though the finale is more complicated).Sadly, said interface is also clunky at times; the text adventure sections are particularly frustrating at times due to the fact that the interface is not always very smart about what you’re telling it to do, and there were a couple points where I struggled to do what I was trying to do due to needing to find the “magic words” so to speak.The only other major problem with the game is the fact that, in the end, the story as it ultimately pans out isn’t really nearly as twisty as you would have hoped based on all the other twists in the game. In fact, I was rather disappointed with the ending, as I was hoping that there was going to be one more twist, or rather, that what you were being pushed towards was not what had really happened, but was yet another lie. Alas, it was missing that extra layer, which I think might have added something more to the experience.If you’re looking for gameplay, this is probably not the place to go looking. And if you aren’t super enamored with dark stories with dark twist endings, this isn’t likely to be up your alley either. If you like a 1980s vibe, though, and a darker sort of vibe, this might be something you’d be interested in. It is certainly a different sort of game.",TitaniumDragon

Same went for medicine, and towards the later parts of the game this started to piss me off, and rather than feel like a difficult challenge, it felt like an unfair trap. Fatal Frame 2 offers a default film that doesn't run out, but is weak. This at least gives you a fighting chance if you run out of film, and makes it so that you are still provided with a challenge-More interesting and difficult puzzles. The puzzles Are more difficult to solve, and actually vary unlike the first one-Is more scary. The ghosts are scarier. They look scarier, and creepier, and act creepier too. They can be unpredictable, and hard to see even when visible because they blend in. Where in the first game, the ghosts were blue, so easy to see, but in this one they are grey.-THE GAME IS LONGER!! Fatal Frame was between 4-5 hours long. This is almost 11 hours long!Where the game weakened:-Well, just as a side note, the game still has you backtrack a lot, but thankfully the game varies wile you do this. But what really hurts the game a little bit is that it's wide open, so 1/6 of the game feels like running long distances all for the sake of backtracking. This is not really a major issue, because the game keeps you entertained while doing so.-Some of the puzzles can be unfair. This happened twice in the game. There are two puzzles where there is a door in the wall, and it doesn't look like a door, it just looks like a wall. Unless you walk around pressing ""X"" on EVERYTHING in the entire room, you won't find it. I ended up searching up where these doors were.All pros and cons aside, Fatal Frame II is an improvement with inevitably a few problems, but it has interesting gameplay, scary moments, and creates the effects you expect from it's genre :D",sckolar

2202,Aragami: Shadow Edition,XboxOne,8,"For me there’s nothing more satisfying than creeping around and performing a stealth move to despatch your enemy, and when these mechanics are done well I end up having a very enjoyable experience with that said game. Thankfully Aragami: Shadow Edition does get those mechanics right and to say I enjoyed my time with the game would be quite the understatement. Speaking about the mechanicsFor me there’s nothing more satisfying than creeping around and performing a stealth move to despatch your enemy, and when these mechanics are done well I end up having a very enjoyable experience with that said game. Thankfully Aragami: Shadow Edition does get those mechanics right and to say I enjoyed my time with the game would be quite the understatement. Speaking about the mechanics this game doesn’t just boast excellent stealth mechanics in fact it has a number of different mechanics in play at the same time and they pretty much combine together flawlessly throughout your time with the game, which is great. Obviously the biggest draw with this game is it’s stealth kills and combat. I’m not exaggerating when I say that performing these stealth kills never gets boring and the combat on the whole feels fluid and responsive at all times thanks to the fantastic controls. Whilst there may not be any issues here the game does suffer with a few technichal issues every now and then, but thankfully none of these issues are too much of a problem and in the end you do end up forgetting about them quite quickly. This is a good thing because in terms of content the game has quite a lot for you to sink your teeth into. This edition of Aragami features all the DLC and when you see the amount of variety the content has it will no doubt keep you satisfied for quite a few hours. Whilst playing on your own is very fun indeed the best way to enjoy this game is when playing with a co-op partner. I must admit that I was very eager to try out the online co-op mode and thankfully it delivered in all areas. Everything about my online experience remained smooth throughout and playing the game this way meant that no game ever played out the same way which in turn gave the game quite a bit of replayability. This included mode also adds even more content to the game and in the end you really do get very good value for your money. Without a doubt one of my favourite things about the game was the presentation side of things. Visually the game has a great dark and mysterious look to it which immerses you in the gameplay immediately. The sound design has also been implemented really well and even though it lacks when it comes to a story the sound design still combines with the visuals really well. At the end of the day fans of anything stealth related will thoroughly enjoy what Aragami: Shadow Edition has to offer. It’s got all the important aspects down to a tee and the best thing is that it remains intriguing throughout which in turn means it’s quite difficult to put down when you get started, and for that reason it gets a big thumbs up from me.",Xbox_Alive
2203,Ys Origin,XboxOne,8,"As this is the first time I’ve ever played a Ys game and I must admit that I don’t know much about the series. I have however heard lots of good things about it and without a doubt it has a big following and now I can understand why. Ys Origin as far as RPG’s go is absolutely brilliant and to say I enjoyed my time with the game would be a massive understatement. The most important aspectAs this is the first time I’ve ever played a Ys game and I must admit that I don’t know much about the series. I have however heard lots of good things about it and without a doubt it has a big following and now I can understand why. Ys Origin as far as RPG’s go is absolutely brilliant and to say I enjoyed my time with the game would be a massive understatement. The most important aspect for me in an RPG is the combat and thankfully it’s been done to perfection. When you’re in combat you get a challenge that doesn’t frustrate you and most important of all it makes you want to carry on because it remains rewarding at all times. Whilst I enjoyed all combat in the game I found the boss battles to be even more enjoyable. When tackling these bosses the gameplay flows flawlessly and you realise how tight and responsive the controls really are, which is great. If you like RPG’s with lots of content then Ys Origin will no doubt satisfy in this area and the best thing is that the content that’s available never seems to get boring so there is a huge amount of replayability. You will however notice a couple of problems as you progress through the content, but thankfully these issues don’t take too much away from the game so you can easily look past them. One thing that really makes Ys Origin stand out from other game’s in the genre is the amount of variety it has. It literally has an abundance of variety in all areas and this without a doubt keeps things fresh and interesting throughout your whole playthrough, which is very rare these days. I don’t really have too many gripes with this game and in fact the only problem I really had was finding out what to do and where to go next. A map would have easily sorted this problem, but I understand why they didn’t implement one because they want you to find your own way which can be fun and annoying at the same time. Despite the game being years old I must admit that I was pretty impressed when it came to the presentation side of the game. The visuals and sound design are packed with charm throughout and this in turn makes the gameplay even more fun and enjoyable. At the end of the day if you like action RPG’s then you will thoroughly enjoy Ys Origin from start to finish. This game has stood the test of time and in my opinion it’s just as good as the more modern games in the genre which is impressive to say the least. There are very few problems in the game and they get all the important mechanics spot on and Ys Origin definitely gets a massive thumbs up from me.",Xbox_Alive

In the case of PDF2, those ones come from the PSP games Project Diva 2nd and Project Diva Extend. Before complaining about rehashing, bear this in mind : while Project Diva Extend was merely transferring songs from Project Diva 2nd, PDF2 remakes them from scratch. Two-faced Lovers, Romio & Cinderella or Luka Luka Night Fever to mention a few, have been completely remades and not just remastered : choreographies have been changed in several aspects, especially by adding a finale like it was introduced in Diva F. No only this, but the incredible 3D engine of the «F» series transforms the hits of the previous generation and the astonishing graphics further enhanced from Diva F (PDF2 looks quite sharper) make it a whole new experience.As for the new songs, I found the list pretty uneven compared to Diva F which was a true concentration of musical masterpieces. Many have slow rythm or not enough intensity for my tastes. But whatever, that’s just me and I did find a few exhilarating compositions like Yubikiri, Ni Soku Hôko, Envy Cat Walk, Meteo 2nd Dimension Fever and Akatsuki Arrival, let alone the fantastic design and direction that mix elegance and cuteness in wonderful fashion.You’ll of course also get a new range of nice modules (=costumes) with the possibility to import the ones you already have in Diva F. In pure aesthetics, you have now an option to put a skin on your progression bar. While I think it takes too much room on the screen, some may please you. Note that if you want more, Sega has planned a looong DLC season to destroy your savings with seriously exciting stuff : the Japanese version already got Change Me, Kochi Muite Baby, Yellow and Sekiranun Graffiti, among others. Remember that if you have the extra character DLC for Diva F, you can get it free for PDF2 as it’s cross-buy.The most striking thing about gameplay is that the game became A LOT harder. If like me you’d come to master progressively the Hard mode without making wonders in Extreme, drop by the chemist’s to get some anxiolytics because you will suffer like hell. Narisumashi Ganga and 2nd Dimension Fever are inhumane, Envy Cat Walk drove me mad. It’s my concern with PDF2 : the Normal mode is still a bit too easy for returning fans, but Hard mode is discouraging sometimes.Generally speaking, the challenge has been beefed up in several ways. Remember the yellow stars for which you just had to scratch the screen continuously? That’s over, Jim! From now on, you’ll have to follow the pace. Technical zones have become a lot more technical, those bonus points are no longer offered like they used to be (Huh, God Tier Tune?). This episodeintroduces some innovations in gameplay, actually new types of stars. There’s the «big» star which is cleared by scratching the screen in two different locations, and the «linked» stars, which are normal stars with more bonusAll the side content is still there and has improved. The Diva Room, the now famous dating sim is more lively than in the previous game : the number of events have doubled, they’re triggered more often, yo have new mini-games and characters show a lot more actions/reactions. Camera angles have been nerfed a lot though, especially in close-up, which is definitely unwelcomed. All the friend level parameters have been tweaked to allow a more precise progression. The much sharper graphics add greatly to the enjoyment of this Diva Room 2.0, which more than ever is a game in itself.The game comes with a dozen of new AR lives, save that now you no longer need the AR markers to organize your private performances!Despite the small hiccups in gameplay and balance, the immense delight is still the same. Project Diva F 2nd is pure and immediate joy until the end. That is, if you can see an end to a game you never really stop playing.",ryuzaki57

This game does so many things right on so many levels it’s astounding, from the stunning visuals & sound design to the humongous variety of incredible race tracks.Make no mistake about it, Redout is FAST.Possibly the greatest futuristic racing game of all time; Redout is an absolutely essential purchase for anyone who’s grown up playing classics like F-Zero, Wipeout and Extreme-G. This game does so many things right on so many levels it’s astounding, from the stunning visuals & sound design to the humongous variety of incredible race tracks.Make no mistake about it, Redout is FAST. Certainly its most divisive element, then, is just how floaty the vehicle handling is relative to both how winding the tracks are as well as their relative visual similarity in each location. This is a blessing in disguise, however, because Redout mandates track memorization and precise driving lines in a way I’ve rarely seen in similar racers. The learning curve is steep, but taking the time to race the tracks over and over to learn their intricacies is utterly addictive.The track design itself is brilliant, constantly temping players with wide straightaways to boost faster and faster through before throwing them into harrowing hairpins, loops and corkscrews. Later courses completely throw reality out the window, serving up some of the wildest tracks seen this side of F-Zero GX, with massive jumps, zero-g segments and only the smallest of margins for error.Redout’s single player campaign was for me worth the price of admission alone- over 120 career mode events cover a wide variety of game modes like time trials, tournament races, survival events and more. It’s sure to take quite a few hours to finish off and does a great job of introducing the player to the game’s mechanics in the slower speed classes before letting them loose with the faster class 3 & 4 ships and the most difficult circuits.Redout’s multiplayer component currently consists of online racing and local split-screen support for up to two players. The online multiplayer works flawlessly and I’ve had a blast in online races, though it’s worth noting that during most hours of the day the online community seems quite dry (certainly not a fault of the game itself). The game also includes online time-trial leaderboards, which is sure to create fun competition amongst the community.I only have two small critiques of Redout at this time- first, while the game’s AI is competitive and certainly challenging for new players learning the game, they tend to be quite easy for advanced players and could use some added difficulty.  Secondly, the console versions currently have some framerate issues preventing them from reaching the target 60 fps.  The developers have stated they’re working on releasing some optimization fixes for those versions so hopefully this will be rectified soon.I honestly cannot recommend Redout enough. I’ve waited literally over a decade for a racer of this magnitude to be released and am absolutely blown away by what 34BigThings has been able to accomplish, from a small independent studio no less. Hope to see you all on the racetrack!",S2riker

Unranked characters can not be used in ranked or vice versa. This game could have been so much better. Especially if Trendy didn't punish it's players for playing the game the way they want. Even if the game encourages you to do so. Oh and they openly encourage modding of the game but then have a zero tolerance policy on any sort of cheating or glitching.

It is quite amazing how dynamic the game is even though it is turn based.In short, in the game you are controlling one of 4 different freelancers on your team. Freelancer is a character with unique fighting abilities, fitting loosely into damage dealer, front line tank and support (generally healing) classes. Your team is pitted against opponents on a relatively small maps which ensure dynamic fight. The first team to score 5 kills or most kills after 20 turns wins. The match takes usually less than 15 minutes, with some extra long matches being below 20.The game may become a classic with huge following; whether that will happen, it is hard to say at the moment. The balance of characters if already rather fine, the matchmaking works, the game is fluid and dynamic and will give you quite some emotions. Skill matters, as well as teamwork. The characters are very varied and unique. The classes are rather loosely defined and the variation within is significant. The unique abilities of characters are unique, which makes it more appreciated how well those are balanced. The balance is enhanced by the match-maker which often chooses similar characters on opposite teams (but not mirrors). So you feel that game is fair - even if you believe one of the freelancers is stronger than the other, often both teams have it.There are some downsides - the voice chat requires external application and at the moment is not widely used - making communication tricky. The time limit for your turn is 15s, which can be short, especially if you learn late what your teammates are doing (their moves are shown once they plot them) and want to make last moment adjustments. The game needs more maps, more fluent communication in teams and perhaps some other modes than 4 vs 4. For example, myself, I am waiting for a mode in which you control all 4 characters in your team for ultimate experience. Nonetheless, the game is already very entertaining and unique, with great much future potential. It is also easy to grab, but difficult to master.Most importantly, it is absolutely no pay to win, even if you play for free. Only skill of you, your teammates, and teamwork matters - money will only get you new skins for your characters and other purely graphical enhancements.Graphics is ok. For me, I do not like the style too much -  but in the age of shiny graphics, it fits the bill.You can try it for free - you will not be able to play all characters, but it will give you the taste of the game. Maybe I am wrong, but if the game is matured a bit and perhaps enhanced with simpler (maybe even 2d) graphics for quick plotting, as well as more fluent communication between teammates, it has potential to become a very solid e-sport game to be played for decades. On the other hand, if the developers will move in wrong direction, it may just die... Currently it is a unique game - surely clones will follow if it gets as much success as I believe it deserves.I was hesitating about the score - finally give it 10 as it is a bold move into where few (or nobody) was before and the design works. It is also more finished than most games at release. The problems are generally minor and common to other team based games, even those which are on the market for many years. Graphics is a matter of taste - and you may like it... No pay to win, skill and teamwork are the only factors affecting the game. Easy to pick, but very complex to master.",Not_Disclosed

This is the world of Battle chef brigade.where you play as Mina an optimistic Human in this fantasy world who dearly wishes to  leave home and compete in this years tournament. You'll join her as she begins her quest  , meet new friends, and try to uncover a deeper plot .The presentation of this game is great from the voiceovers which bring all of the quirky characters to life (I love the two headed Cyclops who banters with himself? his brother head?) . Mina herself is both relatable and adorable  a woman who can  bring down a dragon but has a hard time conquering her alarm clock .   The art aesthetics of the game are great too , I almost feel like I'm watching an anime or reading a Manga at times , Everything looks and is Hand Drawn .  Unfortunately there is a lack of animations which some might find immersion breaking but  I have yet to find a place where I think an additional walk cycle here or more frames of animation there would amplify my experience.  Lastly the music is great , subtle but much like the art and voiceovers it keeps you sort of energized as you balance the diverse mechanics of the gameplay .The  core gameplay for Battle chef brigade centers on two primary  mechanics 2D brawling / platforming  for hunting and collecting ingredients  and a matching puzzle game for the actual cooking .portion .  I Expected this to be a Puzzle game with a tacked on crappy action sequence but truly the fighting feels fantastic  and it requires more than just  button mashing . Doing a 4 hit combo into a dodge move before unleashing your whirlwind magic to get some ribs for your entree will definitely happen .The puzzle-focused cooking is great too . There are gems of thee element types ( Water, Fire , Earth) and by combining the gems you can level up and amplify the flavor and  quality of each ingredient in your your entree.  Even this is deeper than I expected though as The type of pans you cook in can determine if it becomes a match two or match three sequence , you can implement sauces which will change gyms and by mixing special non-element Items you can further enhance your dish .So you've spent a few minutes hunting , you  have spent a few minutes preparing your dish ,  now what? Time to present your  Meal to the judges !  I think the actual inclusion of Judges makes this game   even more Awesome. Before each round in the tournament your character and opponent get a small ceremonial intro , the Judge is presented  and they mention what flavors they enjoy and you are given a meal theme item to implement . once You've finished prepping the meal they will evaluate your opponents Dish and then yours and whoever scores highest wins  the round .  The dishes when finished look delicious and have made me legitimately hungry and hearing the judges critique your and your opponents dishes feels real as they talk about the flavors they like but perhaps the lack of presence in the theme item .Much like the theme of this game  it's mechanics it provides and stirs together enough different aspects in its own unique way that it feels fresh , fun , and fulfilling .  My only gripe is that an "" Arcade mode"" or  quick tournament ladder mode of some sort would be amazing  but for what it's worth the game does provide a daily cooking challenge so that you can compete against other players and  two "" free modes"" where you can practice just hunting or just cooking respectively .As someone who went into Battle Chef Brigade not knowing a ton about it it has been an absolutely delightful and appetizing experience.",JJ1990

I was mostly unimpressed in the implementation of most of these features.I will preface this by stating that I am a veteran of Paradox games and purchase nearly every one of their products (you might even call me a fanboi).This expansion adds a number of interesting features, including colonial nations, expanded native gameplay, protectorates, and a randomized new world (optional).  I was mostly unimpressed in the implementation of most of these features.Prior to this expansion, you would directly control your colonial holdings.  Post-expansion, once you have settled 5 provinces in a ""colonial region"" (the new world is split up into various set regions), the colonies turn into an AI-controlled colonial nation.  This addition, as a whole, is a nice touch.  It gives your colonies their own personalities and desires outside of your own, which is appropriate.  However, if you were to play one of these colonial nations, you'll realize that they're all the same.  There are no unique national ideas even if you form the USA (or Brazil or Haiti, etc.).  As a recurring theme among this expansion, there is a lack of depth.  For example, there is an extreme deficit in colonial nation specific events.Native gameplay has a few new features.  However, after playing one of the natives, I find they are still quite boring.  The migration feature is cute, allowing you to move your tribe from one province to another, but it has no real long-term value.  Eventually, you realize that you can colonize adjacent provinces with your natives and then it becomes a game of just sitting around, colonizing, while you wait for the Europeans to arrive.  There is truly little action in the New World, despite this expansion being devoted to it.  Again, there is absolutely no Native American specific events (and in fact, they receive inappropriate European events)  Furthermore, South American nations were not even touched.Protectorates are an absolute disaster.  The AI does not know how to handle them properly.  For example, Muscovy will often form a protectorate with surrounding hordes rather than conquering them, as would be optimal.  This system needs a bit of an overhaul.  Perhaps with some proper AI programming, as well, it might work.Finally, the randomized new world...  It's quite simply ugly, unnatural, and repulsive.  It follows a simple equation, it seems, in which the center of the continent is desert, followed by forests around the edge, with ugly coasts.  The province borders look like the borders of Africa - straight lined, hard corners, etc.In total, I give this game a ~5.  It still needs polishing.  If, some day, they improve the randomization feature for the new world, they add a plethora of events for natives and colonial nations, they add unique nations ideas for these colonial nations (it's an expansion focused on these nations, why wouldn't they think it's worthwhile!?), make the prior released American Dream DLC work with this expansion, then they might have something great.  Paradox is great at post-release fixes, so there is hope that this expansion might some day rise to the quality that we have come to expect.",Dr_Dan

Its got its ups and downs but some of the things that happen in this game are absolutely ridiculous. First off, fast RB/QB combinations are way too overpowering. For instance, Michael Vick and Lesean McCoy. Not only is Vick way too fast, but he is also way too elusive. Its like playing with the same Michael Vick that I played with in Madden 2004. Not only is Vick not as fast as he was as in 04 but he is also a much much worse football player. Madden doesn't seem to realize that though. Vick is amazing in this game and to be honest I would almost take him over any QB in the league. Lesean McCoy is way too good in this game as well. Yes I know that McCoy is usually good, but after an under performing season last year he should not be nearly as good. Greg Jennings is another player that in my mind is way too good. Not only did he have 4 TDs, but he had some amazing jumping and diving catches. Yes I know that Greg Jennings is good, but he is not this good. This Greg Jennings would have fit in the game if it was 5 years before. Another thing that is absolutely ridiculous is the kick/punt returns. They are so simple that it reminds me of playing with Devin Hester in Madden 2009 or Madden 2010 when anytime he touched the ball it was a touchdown. Man coverage is something that Madden needs to focus on because its absolute horse  in this game. It's almost as if the DBs don't know what they are doing. The middle of the passing screen also needs to be fixed. As long as I pass across the middle every time I am guaranteed at least 8 yards which is ridiculous. I know its a video game but come on Madden. Its simple stuff like that that needs to be fixed. Oh and one more thing is that the LT+any button mode is way to overpowered. I once made Reggie Bush fumble 5 times in one game using LT+hit stick. On the opposite side there are some pluses. The blocking is much more realistic and blocks are starting to look like ones that you see in the NFL. Guys getting pushed down, pancakes and other blocks. The owner mode is also tons of fun and it really makes it realistic that you own a franchise with all the things you have to do to please your fans and your team. The introductions before the game are also a really nice touch and makes it really cool and jacked up to play the game. Speed should NOT be everything though because in the NFL just cause your fast doesnt mean that youre good. I really love Madden, and no matter what I will buy it every year, but some changes need to be made to make me more satisfied.

Since diplomacy is so schitzophrenic you can ignore it for that purpose, and it spreads on its own (eventually), or you can use a missionary or great prophet to speed it up. Great prophets have no other real use then spreading religion, unlike other great people (who you can buy with faith later, likely added because the points would be virtually worthless once the religion is buffed up otherwise). Spies are really limited in what they can do, and since tech stealing is so prevalent you'll want to use a couple to defend against it pretty much all the time. That makes the whole system really limited and passive. If you thought Civ 5 was a great game already then you'll enjoy this, but IMO Civ 4 did both of these systems better.",Tridus

In a colonial american game, should native american civs have been there already? You shouldn't have to pay extra! They did a nice job of making the civs unique, however, I still prefer the european races because they are BETTER. I mean, sure, you can have your barracks that shoot (Exactly like the russian civ in the original) but it doesn't make up for the fact that you can't build forts, which become even more powerful in the expansion as you can now have as many as you want via the alternative option to going Imperial age, revolting. Now, I know your colonists are already pretty gross... No, not that kind or revolting. Revolting basically shuts down your economy, meaning that if you do it without at least 2 forts and 5000 of each resource, you're an idiot. It turns all your villagers into militia, which I actually found pretty useful in 1v1. For the cost of the age up price (1000 of each resource) you instantly have a huge army. Since you are cut off from your home city, your cards are replaced with 4 new ones: The ironclad, a combo between the frigate and the monitor, a medium shipment of militia, 4 Gatling guns (Which can also be trained at foundries) or a fort wagon. That's right, as soon as you age up, you can have infinite forts. Kinda makes the native american tribes pale in comparison, right? In addition, the europeans get 2 new buildings. Native embassies (Basically an easy way to train native soldiers) and a saloon, which lets you train mercenaries. The war chief game also adds 2 new campaigns, but once again, it's predecessor had lots more than that, and those were actually historically accurate. At least these campaigns don't have magic in them like that ""Fountain of Youth"" s*** we got in AOE III. Or at least not as much magic. The game also adds a new ability called stealth. Sounds pretty cool. So, stupidly, I bought a ""shipment of some stealthy sneaky spies"" Excited, I cloaked by guys, planning to send them into his base and assassinate his leader (Which was a faulty plan anyways, they still haven't made the enemy AI smart enough to not send their explorers on suicide missions, ransom them back, or make any attempt to rescue them once they've gotten killed by a stray kitten) Turns out ""Turn invisible to enemy sight"" means ""Turn invisible until you walk within the line of sight of any of his units"" So apparently at the generous price of only walking at half speed, I get to turn invisible until I reach the spot where I would have been spotted without the cloak anyways.All in all, if you got tricked into buying the original AOE III, this may alleviate your pain, but only slightly. Personally, I wouldn't pay any more than $10 for this. Luckily I was not fooled into buying their second expansion which looks like it, once again, was just adding civs that were already in AOE II and ITS expansion, both of which could be found at the dollars store, sometimes packaged together.",HwoDragon

Set in a urban fantasy version of New York City, the player takes the role of one of four powerful magic users who have entered pocket dimension known as the Crucible of Fates, in order to find their destinies.Combat is extremely fast and frenetic and the difficulty level ramps up extremely quickly, in later levels it's almost impossible to avoid taking damage without judicious use of your Shadow Walk, which allows you to quickly change location, and your Glyph, which is a powerful offensive spell. The problem there is that these abilities have only limited uses per fight, and using them further will consume energy cells, which are somewhat rare. Further complicating matters is that mana, which is needed to purchase passive skill upgrades, only drops if you kill an enemy using Shadow Walk or a Glyph, though there is a passive that gives your basic attack a chance to knock mana out of enemies.You can earn permanent upgrades for each character by accomplishing certain objectives given to you during runs, this is also how you unlock new characters, and hard mode, which must be unlocked separately for each character.Uniquely, in Leap of Fate your passive skill trees are randomized in each playthrough. Veteran players advise restarting a run if you do not like your tree's layout. These passives are split into three trees: basic attack upgrades, shadow walk upgrades, and general-purpose passives. I advise grabbing the ""Third Eye"" skill where possible, it makes planning your run much easier.You begin with only Aeon, the Shadow Mage, and can unlock Big Mo the Technomancer, Mukai the Spirit Channeler and Rasimov the Rogue Occultist. Each has a different basic attack, a different starting buff for Shadow Walk, and unique glyph. Aeon has a spread shot, a simple shadow bolt glyph, and can damage enemies by Shadow Walking through them. Big Mo has a continuous-fire beam that can overheat, an aoe damage grenade, and can turn invisible when Shadow Walking, leaving a holographic decoy behind. Mukai has a close range cleaving attack, a glyph that stuns an enemy, and can fire a projectile when Shadow Walking. She also has a shield that intercepts the first hit she takes in each fight, to compensate for her alarmingly low starting health of just 3. Rasimov is perhaps the most interesting character, as he does not spend mana to purchase upgrades, but instead spends health. He has a conical damage attack that will instead fire a large projectile if he does not attack for a short time, a glyph that places an explosive trap that sucks enemies in, and can slow down time for enemies when Shadow Walking. Enemies Rasimov kills with his skills drop souls, and when he collects enough souls he receives an upgrade and a health pickup.Considering this is also a cellphone game, Leap of Fate's aesthetics are impressive. Music, visual effects, and sound are all good, but notably I thought the voice acting was of unusually good quality for a game like this. Each of the four characters has five possible endings, greatly increasing the lifespan of a game you could otherwise beat in less then an hour... if you're lucky.",Captain_Chaos

And since the two games are so technically similar (very minor resolution/game-engine improvements in the sequel) there is really no reason to skip the first. So DON'T DO IT :)Anyways if you loved the first the second shouldn't disappoint as it faithfully continues and completes the original story. The familiar cast of characters are all back, new ones are added (even a villain of sorts), the locations (we finally get to Syberia!), voice work, dialogue, and length (~12hrs?) are all on par with the original. There is even quite the plot twist involving one of the main characters that genuinely surprised me. And oh, the cell phone this time around has taken on a reduced role which I greatly welcomed as it tended to get a little annoying in the first.As for puzzle aficionados they aren't exactly this game's strong suit (though I guess the same could be said of the original Syberia.) There are a few good ones like the plane and the large ivory flute (a Myst-like puzzle), but there are also quite a few duds. In fact, some could hardly be categorized as puzzles at all but rather blatant time fillers that involve you walking down a linear path, picking up an item at the dead end, only to have to backtrack the same linear path to the beginning just to click a button to proceed. That's not a puzzle, that's not adding to the story or gameplay, and it certainly isn't fun. Its just pointless. Others lacked sufficient clues forcing upon you a trial-and-error method to complete them. Not the worst thing ever, but when some of these same trial-and-error puzzles were accompanied by either long walks or having to sit through deliberately drawn out character animation sequences with repetitive voice overs it quickly got annoying (I'm looking at you fishing puzzle!).But, perhaps most frustrating for me was this game seems to have introduced a progression through dialogue tree system that I don't recall being in the first (or maybe it was more subtlety done?). Its not enough to talk to people with the same keyword once, or twice, but sometimes three times just to advance the story. I literally talked to everyone in an area then spent 20+ minutes just pixel hunting, backtracking, scratching my head with a puzzle thinking I missed something; talked to everyone a second time, repeated the pixel hunt, only to remained bewildered and in the end find out it wasn't a puzzle at all that was preventing my advance, but rather it was because I didn't badger all the NPCs with the same keywords a 3rd time! Arrrg!These things don't ruin the game. Not even close, but they did sour me enough that I will always remember the original Syberia more fondly. Final score: 7.5/10",notyourbuddy

This is a conversion of a well-respected but little-known PS2 game and I think in many ways it has found its happiest home on PSP. The analogue slider suits the control system really well and for once it actually enhances the game (though long riffs will make your thumb cry out for a rest). Actually, that comment about thumbs is very appropriate. This game makes your thumbs bleed like they used to in olden days. It is a proper skill-based game and properly hard like games used to be. I no longer have the skills to excel at games like this (and probably never did if I'm honest). Also, my piano teacher would attest to the fact that my rhythm is not the best. But if you miss the old days when games were a challenge and you had to actually learn the levels in order to survive then I think you'll like this game. In this case you're learning songs and beats rather than enemy patterns but practice is essential and it really took me back to the good old days of gaming. As required in a music game, the music is excellent and varied. It all involves you playing the guitar part but goes through most genres on its way through its ten levels. The game also has that madcap appeal that only crazy Japanese games can have. The story is suitably bizarre and the characters are uniquely styled. Inspired by PaRappa, this game has come from people with equal amounts of imagination and vision. Unfortunately the game is cursed by that regular PSP affliction - loading times. The loads between levels seem to go on for ages and serve only to break the flow of the game. I'm sure this aspect at least would have been better on PS2. If it wasn't for that problem I would have thought seriously about giving this game a perfect score. It's quite fantastic in an old-fashioned, pure-gameplay sense. If you think you are up to the challenge and your thumbs know how to dance then this comes very highly recommended.",ChrisP.

Once again, we have a game here which is nothing more than an over-elaborate spreadsheet that ignores your instructions.What do I mean by that? Well, there's a plethora of options here - you can tweak pretty much everything and anything you want - but none of that really matters when you come to a game and you see everything you set being ignored by the match engine, as players float around like they're on ice (again) and 'keepers laughably dive over weak shots, strikers sky over the bar from one yard out and so on. I'm not expecting every player to follow instructions every game - I understand you can get beat and need to adjust etc. - but I expect at least a semblance of it playing out on the pitch. Since they changed the engine a few years back, everything you do doesn't seem to matter.And it's not just me being bad at the game, or new to it. I've played these titles since CM97/98. I still win in this game, but it isn't a result of my decisions beyond stumbling across one semi-broken 4-2-3-1 tactic and spamming Continue. Why bother with the intricacies if they make no discernible difference in getting a result and, indeed, are more likely to cost me one?The graphics engine is improved in terms of animations and fluency, but as noted above everyone just skates around. It's a completely immersion killer - just stick to the 2D engine unless you fancy a laugh at just how bad the action is portrayed in 3D.There's been barely any innovation elsewhere. Press conferences are still painfully annoying. Training settings are still convoluted. A few graphs have been added here and there. The one good addition (yet already repetitive) is the social media feed, except even a no-mark club from the lower reaches of Italian football apparently has the same social media profile as Real Madrid, but willing to let that slide.My overall impression is a game that is both stale and fundamentally broken. Every year we get a video from Miles going on about how this is the ""best year ever"", yet the game barely changes, and what changes they do make add yet another pile of crap to sift through when the reality is they should be fixing things and removing what doesn't work to make the game accessible and accurate on the pitch. As it stands, this game is not fun - it's work. It's like a job you pay for and clock into because habit tells you to.Yes, blame can be placed on SEGA for forcing the yearly releases, but SI don't escape it - for a good three to four years now, they've went down the FIFA path of releasing what basically amount to patches, and not good ones either.

This is not one of those games. It's got gunfights, it's got humour, it's got quests, it's got an open world. Sure it's small, but that doesn't take away from everything that it does so well.Its best part is that you can do anything, confront anyone, pull a gun during a conversation, anything, and the game will adapt. For example, if you killed a major figure in the game, it wouldn't show a ""GAME OVER"" screen and make you load a save. It just ends any quests to that person, and can even make people act negatively towards you and even kill you.The size of the game is surprisingly large. There's a main story that's a bit short, but is sweet all the way, helped by the hundreds of side quests, free-roaming and mini-games that you can find. When you complete the game's main story you can continue from right before the ending starts, so you can continue any other side quests and explore things you missed. You can also play as different characters that you unlock through playing the game, that can change the playstyle completely.Its gunfights are incredibly unique too, due to mechanics like reloading and cocking guns. First you have to draw your weapon, then cock it so that it's ready to fire, then pull the trigger. This can make for sometimes annoying fights (especially when first getting used to them) but ultimately makes them fast-paced, satisfying and fun. Another thing to mention that may be annoying to new players is that you can only shoot side-on rather than up and down, but when you get used to it, feels very good when you actually hit someone.The sounds and music are just amazing. The music has got it all going for a Western-themed game, with banjos, harmonicas and trumpets humming in the background that truly immerse you in the game.

I mean, it goes without saying that one can try and beat the par times in each level for a bit of added challenge, but it's just you doing the same motions again a bit quicker.

I bought it last tuesday on ebay and receive yesterday. The gameplay is arcade perfect and sound and graphic too! Loading times are short and small slowdown of framerate is only in Metal Slug 2 (like MVS cabinet version). All other 6 games (Metal Slug 1 X 3 4 5 6) have smooth framerate. Everything other seems to be fine, but is not. I found difference between manual and game. For example: in manual is that there is display option, that you can set Original pixel, Full screen and 4:3. But in game option there is no display option! And in manual is that if I choose EASY, it give me 30 credits, if I choose NORMAL, it give me 20 credits and if I give HARD, it give me 10 credits. But in game option, there I can choose between EASY MEDIUM and HARD, but it no changes number of credits. I can set 20 10 or 5 credits. That is different. And in maual is that: ""Continues - Choose between Unlimited or Limited continuse. Okay...so you think you have got the ""right stuff""? Choose ""Limited"" and see if you can beat the game with a set number of lives. Special bonus items await to the true METAL SLUG champion."" In game i cant set to the limited, because there is only FREE PLAY, 5, 10, 20. and there are more differences between manual and game. For example, on page 8, there isi some Token system and Wallpapers in Gallery but in game there arent. And in manual is, that if I give PAUSE MENU, there I can save my current game. But in game this function isnt. I think this PS2 manual of Metal Slug Anthology is only slighty updated PSP manual. Because, in this PS2 manual do not fits pictures. On page 8, there is something with Game Lobby and Connect. And the buttons are Playstations. Surely the pictures are from PSP version. And I read review for PSP version of MSA, that in PSP version you can choose between Original resolution, 4:3 and 16:9. I think that is enought to say, that the MANUAL have a LOT OF DIFFERENCES. BUT THAT DO NOT AFFECT ON GAMES. THEY ALL ARE GREAT!",Tomas

Also it gets repetitive towards the end.- There are not many bugs, but the ones I had are annoying. For example, I lost all my men due to hunger at one point but the game still goes on, random events about problems of the people in caravan still emerging (even if there are none left). I also think that you can play whole game on easy, and then switch to hard on last battle, and you'll get achievement for finishing it on hard (steam).- I played this game on normal. For me, the game quickly turned to hunger game (you're marching without stop 'cause you don't have enough food, and every renown you get, you use on buying more food). Battles tend to be easy with little practice, but if you played whole game on normal last battle is almost impossible. Hence, I got achievement for finishing it on easy, even if I played only last battle that way- The game map is useless, except if you're into reading more walls of text to figure out the whole ""setting"" of this game (I think that is ""RPG"" element)- It is clear that this is meant to be just first part of series, 'cause game ends pretty much in the middle of things. Its like you sit and watch just first part of the lord of the rings.All in all, since this is advertised as indie game and it's from kickstarter, it is very good. Bearing that in mind, price of 23 euros is just too high, that's why my score is that low. Add +2 to score if you don't care about money and waiting for (possible) next chapter in this saga. 10-15 euro price tag would be more appropriate for this game.",joggy

The Toy Box is much more robust, the two Star Wars and one Inside Out playsets are far better designed than the 2.0 playsets which didn't feel worth the price, and the amount of design and customization is better than ever.I get the feeling that most of the poor reviews are here simply due to the cost and, to be fair, they have a legitimate complaint. I have no intention of buying ALL the Star Wars figures or Power Disks but, so far, I've spent far too much on the Saga bundle, Yoda, Obi-Wan, Sabine Wren, and pre-ordering Darth Vader, Chewbacca, and Han Solo. $202.94, to be exact, on all of it. I can COMPLETELY understand the complaints about cost, especially given that Infinity 1.0 and 2.0 playsets aren't forward compatible.But the cost complaint doesn't make the game a zero, nor does it make the game any less enjoyable. Infinity 3.0 reminds me oh so much of the old LEGO series before Traveler's Tales oversaturated the market with them. If that sounds like your cup of tea, you won't be disappointed. My only advice is - if you're not buying for kids - stick to one specific subset of figures (in my case, Star Wars) or you'll quickly find your money going away. And don't bother with the power disks unless you ABSOLUTELY feel compelled to throw away $10 per set.I do strongly recommend the Toy Box Speedway when it comes out in October, especially if the quality is the same as the Toy Box Takeover (also available in October but given as a preorder bonus).",Captiosus

However, the game is becoming more popular in the west because of the violence and its story.The story is amazing in Yakuza Kiwami (I can't really put a summary without spoiling bits of the story so just take my word for it). The game takes place 17 years after Yakuza 0 so for those of you who have played Y0, its the same combat system as the previous one but this time you gain experience points which you use to unlock abilities. For those who have not played Y0 (I highly recommend that you do), to unlock abilities you would use in game currency. This can be obtained by beating enemies, doing real estate etc. Furthermore, the dev's added new cutscenes to show how the main villian...became the villain. I didn't manage to finish the original but I think those cutscenes was absent in the original game, also there are less loading times especially in fights so you can start and end fights quicker. The combat is more fast paced than Y0 (as long as you upgrade abilities).There is a new system called Majima everywhere. You basically fight Majima at random times and most times you fight him under ridiculous but hilarious circumstances. The main purpose is to unlock more abilities for the last skill tree.Advantages:+ Combat is fun and fast paced+ Combat is very cathartic+ Story is very interesting+ Characters are interesting and you will remember most characters in this game+ Skill tree is huge+ Majima everywhere can be a tad bit repetitive but rewarding (since you unlock abilities)+ Side quests/Sub stories are funny and interesting+ There are various things to do in Y:Kiwami e.g. Hostess clubs, batting cages, karaoke etc.+ Graphics and cut scenes look very nice+ New cutscenesThe disadvantages of this game is that:- There is less content than Y0- Random street fights can be repetitive- Loading time to get in and out of buildings can be quite long (5 mins)But overall a great game I highly recommend.",Groot650
